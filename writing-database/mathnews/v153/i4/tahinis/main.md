Inspired by _Dick Smithers_’ "Comprehensive Review of Crush Social Eatery" in mathNEWS v153i3, I recently set out to experience and comprehensively review the new shawarma restaurant opened on Philip St across from Molly’s, Tahini’s. 

Tahini’s is the latest shawarma establishment to compete for the denizens of the university plaza. They have over 28 locations across Ontario, and originally hail from (the other) London. As a London escapee, this new Philip St location brings back memories of meeting last-minute dates amid the aroma of falafel and the lights of the Bitcoin ATM their London locations were famous for.

The new Tahini’s on Philip St doesn’t quite have the same atmosphere, but the menu remains strong. They’re still in the early stages though; their service is abysmally slow relative to FreshBurrito or even Shawarma Plus, and their packaging could use some work - they don’t even give you a bag or napkins, they just hand you the minimally-wrapped shawarma and wish you a nice day - but with time, it has potential to live up to its London reputation. Maybe they’ll even raise their “Order here” sign after some time; I hit my head on it while trying to get to the counter to order. 

That’s basically the entire review. They need a while to get things together, but with time, I believe they’ll be able to give Shawarma Plus a run for their money.

Can we revisit that Bitcoin ATM? What the _fuck_ is up with that?

How often do you see a Bitcoin ATM? Maybe in the back corner of a shady convenience store, or in a forever-empty currency conversion shop in some forgotten nook of Conestoga mall. Shawarma restaurants can often be liminal spaces, but there are limits, and Bitcoin ATMs are well beyond them. Maybe, maybe if you want to order 3526.429 chicken shawarma wraps[1], you can order them with a Bitcoin, but have you considered at that point just buying the restaurant instead?

That’s not it though. The below image is a [real t-shirt you can buy on Tahini’s’s website](https://tahinis.com/products/bitcoin-fire?variant=39405576060973). This is not a joke. This is real Tahini’s branding.

It doesn’t stop here. The reason for all this Bitcoin branding?

Every dollar they put into long-term reserves[2] is invested entirely into Bitcoin.

This is an insane business play. Almost all Canadian organizations keep their savings in $CAD or $USD, both of which being reasonably-stable options for long term savings. Time value of money aside, if your business puts $50 CAD in a savings account in 2020, they can reasonably expect to still have about $50 CAD in that savings account by 2023. Not Tahini’s. In August 2020, they moved _all of their long-term corporate balance sheets_ to Bitcoin. 

When Bitcoin crashed in mid-2022, they would have lost around 66% of their earnings from 2021. For a chain of their size, that is probably enough to pay the full tuition of every Math/Teaching student at the University of Waterloo today. Randomly gone. Oopsies.

I want to be able to make this out to be a poor decision. I really don’t want to say that this worked. I don’t want to praise this business model. 

It worked.

When the pandemic struck in 2020, Tahini’s only had three stores, all in London, Ontario. They’ve now increased that number ninefold, spreading all across southwestern Ontario. In early 2022 they claimed to have never drawn from their Bitcoin savings, but given their rate of expansion amid a time of increasing interest rates, inflation, and engaging in a nationwide dance with recession, I think it is reasonable to conclude that their Bitcoin savings have propelled their expansion.

Renowned Harvard business professor Michael Porter suggested all businesses use a generic strategy, split along the lines of low-cost/high-cost and niche/focused. I’d like to suggest a fifth Porter generic strategy: fucked. Fucked up. Sick and twisted. The fucked strategy.

Businesses aren’t supposed to be able to explode because of memeing all their profits into Bitcoin. They’re supposed to grow based on genuine competitive advantage, well-structured operations, and strong market fit. And Tahini’s has those, sure, but simultaneously, their success is in no small part driven by memeing all of their profits into Bitcoin.

Tahini’s is what happens when you give r/wallstreetbets complete ownership of a restaurant chain. It is a monument to spite. It is a testament to “fuck it, we ball” as one of the strongest business strategies ever conceived.

They have pretty good shawarma, too.

--postscript--

1. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was at $47,778.53 CAD. One bitcoin paying for chicken shawarma wraps ($11.99 \* 1.13 HST) comes out to 3526.4291039 chicken shawarma wraps.
2. They always maintain enough Canadian currency in their account to operate for the next 3-6 months. Beyond that? Any earnings they make become Bitcoin.
