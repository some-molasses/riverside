There’s a bench outside Billy Bishop airport, at which you can sit with a granola bar and wait for your flight to land.  Sometimes you have a MATH 239 exam instead of a flight, but you can visit the bench anyway.

I didn’t live in the GTA growing up.  Toronto wasn’t so far to be visited once in a lifetime, but more than twice a year was excess.  It was a special treat; consumed under the summer sun for a long-planned weekend away from home.  I’d never seen it during Christmas.

It’s Thursday night when I realize I would like to finally see it.  The Kitchener GO does not run on weekends, and the window of time to MATH 239, my subsequent exams, and immediately going back home is closing.  If I were to see Christmas in Toronto, it would have to be Friday, barely two waking hours away.  

The morning alarm brings only regret.  Why be here, awake, when rest is so near?  I prepare breakfast anyway.  I have the means to make pancakes—why be here, making normal weekday cereal and molasses-topped yogurt when I can reward myself for surviving the term?  I eat my cereal.  A new game update released the day before—why be here, walking out of my apartment at 8:05 AM, when I can have a slow morning playing video games after so many weeks without?  I leave for the train station.

The train is canceled, of course.  The trip just became substantially harder; why am I here, looking up alternate routes?  Why am I here, on a bus to Bramalea?  Why am I here, standing in the cold at Bramalea GO?  Why am I here, on a train to Union? 

_Why am I here?_

I convinced myself that upon reaching Toronto, I would immediately head to the University of Toronto, hide away in a nice study space, and study graph theory surrounded by UofT students unaware they’d been infiltrated.  The university is dead north of Union Station, so I emerge onto Front St and head west.

A little known fact about Billy Bishop airport is that it exists.  Another little known fact about Billy Bishop airport, located on Toronto Island, is that you can walk to it.  A tunnel runs under the lake at the island’s closest point to shore, under the stretch of water where the world’s least ambitious ferry daily spans a stretch of what cannot be more than one hundred fifty metres.  Deferring UofT for later, I follow the tunnel, not knowing why.  If the island was calling me, it called my legs only.

I found a bench outside Billy Bishop airport, at which you can sit with a granola bar and wait for your flight to land.  Sometimes you have a MATH 239 exam instead of a flight, but you can visit the bench anyway.

Nothing about this was optimal.  If I was optimizing my studies, I could have just studied at CnD, fueling my studies with hot chocolate and samosas.  If I was optimizing my rest, I could have stayed home, slept in, and played games until sunset.  If I was optimizing for Christmas, I could have taken a bus back home to my family, been home for Christmas early, and come back Sunday night to finish my exams.  In no way was eating a granola bar outside Billy Bishop Airport an optimal choice.  It wasn’t on the list of optimal choices; it wasn’t on the list of choices to begin with.

Absurdity.  It follows neither rhyme nor reason, is by nature unexpectable, and is rarely the optimal choice of any timeframe.  No artificial intelligence optimizes for absurdity.  They have goals, metrics, Markov chains of possible outcomes all optimizing to some form of success—every decision is considered, rationalized, set upon a throne of logic and data points.  Artificial intelligence rejects absurdity by nature of its being.

If our lives can be replicated by an algorithm, can it be said that we are alive?

When I came to Waterloo, I promised myself I would live.  I would finally break free of the comfortably lifeless subsistence my cornfield-enclosed suburbia offered, claiming instead the fundamental birthright: life.  But the quiet death of subsistence is not unique to my home.  It lurks in every shadow at Waterloo, every day you grind studying, every night you rest with the same lonely activities, every well-worn path you take to class, every optimal path you do on repeat.  Quiet death thrives amid the repeated pursuit of optimality.

If death thrives in optimality, then absurdity defines life.

Chase absurdity.  It is why we are here.

--postscript--

I did eventually reach UofT, although not a single note of MATH 239 studying was accomplished.  I did, however, accidentally find and enter Queen’s Park, experience many aspects of Toronto at Christmas, and walk enough steps that my phone and my legs believe I should be sedentary for the next week.
