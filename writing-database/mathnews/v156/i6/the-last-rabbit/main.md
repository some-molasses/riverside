The wildlife had left.

Few of the local housecats remember their time. Long ago, the valley was full of wild creatures. The raccoons, the turtles, the heron, and most importantly, the rabbit. None remain. None are remembered, etched into legends told at the housecats’ secret midnight meets.

None but the rabbit. 

When the humans came to the valley, the housecats say the raccoons were the first to try to leave. The rabbit, however, had other plans. The raccoons saw job opportunities far away, it’s said; far away, garbage collectors were in high demand. Garbage collectors? What an absurd reason to leave. 

The rabbit would show they could collect garbage at home. 

When the humans came to transform the valley, cutting down trees and uprooting the forest floor, the rabbit stowed away their scraps. As they brought in their machines, the rabbit mapped out all their favourite dumping sites. When the humans installed trash cans, the rabbit journeyed into the pre-dawn fog, throwing his little weight against the black cans until they spilled their rotten contents onto the muddy ground. When the valley had been cleared, and only upturned dirt remained, the rabbit again found the raccoons. “Look!”, said the rabbit, presenting his maps. “There is such garbage here! I have drawn you maps, I have spread more for you to find! You need not go away, everything you need is here!” 

But the raccoons were already leaving. They expressed their appreciation, they invited him to visit, but no effort he made could get them to stay. 

It was not the same.

He did not think about it long. Later that very day, he encountered the turtles with all their belongings stacked upon their shells. “Leaving now?” the rabbit exclaimed. “What about our Winter fair? What about our summer concerts? You can’t leave, you’ll never see them again!”

But the turtles dreamt of the sea. There was no sea in the valley.

Not yet. The rabbit bounded to the human cabins. Days he stalked them; while the humans constructed the housecats’ homes, he learned their patterns, their vision, their habits, until one day, he snuck into their office. He took a pen between his teeth. On all the humans’ blueprints of the valley, he drew a great blue pond.

Wooden frames rose. New trees sprouted from the earth. Oil and steel roared along their gravel roads. Soon enough, the humans dug a hole. Within the week, a great pond nine hundred rabbit lengths across took shape within the valley. 

It was not enough. Their shells piled high, the turtles walked into the world beyond. The valley had water, but for all the rabbit’s efforts to persuade the turtles otherwise, it was no sea. 

It was not the same.

The raccoons had garbage, the turtles had water, but no one would stay. Human children ruled the valley now; their lights cast away the darkness each night. Soon, only the rabbit and a lone heron remained. One day, the heron told the rabbit he was leaving too. 

In all the construction, the heron’s pond had been lost. But the rabbit could find it. As the humans took their yellow machines away, and the last homes replaced mud and clay for grass and trees, again the rabbit stole into the construction office. With his tiny paws, he opened their steel drawers, searching through map after map. He found one. 

That night, the rabbit and the heron journeyed. The last two creatures walked the paved streets, crossing between streetlight beams and mowed lawns. Arriving at a house, the rabbit dug his paws into the earth, carving a tunnel under their backyard fence. Within the home’s backyard, untouched, as it always was, they found the heron’s pond.

The heron stood in the waters. He stuck his beak under the surface. He splashed with his wings. He looked at the rabbit, and turned his head. 

“Is this the same pond?”

The rabbit was confused. Of course it’s the same pond, he had checked. Didn’t the heron recognize it? The rabbit double checked, he stood beside the heron and looked into the evening water; in its reflection, a rabbit and a heron looked back out at him. 

“It has to be the same,” the rabbit said. 

He looked at the heron, confused.

“Perhaps, dear rabbit. It may be the same water.”

For a moment, he stood there.

“But it is not the same time.”

The heron flew away.

The rabbit stayed in the old valley a while longer. He continued his same morning forages. He still passed by the raccoons’ old warrens, now barren. He passed by the turtles’ old bushes, now a fire hydrant. He passed by the heron’s old pond, now locked away. New creatures came, but they were different. Younger. Brighter. He never got to know them. Winter came, and with it, frost. While the new housecats of the valley could convince the humans to let them into their warm homes, the rabbit never seemed able to.

Ask any of the housecats of the valley, and they’ll tell you about him. The last rabbit. They won’t bring you to him. The younger ones say he was run over by a truck.

But ask the oldest housecat, who lives in the house on the hill, and he’ll tell you a different story. He’ll tell you that one night, in a pure whiteout, the rabbit must have gotten lost, for the housecat saw him bounding by in the early morning light. By pure accident, in the blinding snow, he had made it atop the valley’s eastern hillside. He had made it out.

From atop that hill, he had would have seen not only his own valley, but countless more. Rich with life, some human, some wild. From above, they would have all looked look the same. Even his own. Did he have to stay? No path down led to the valley of his youth. 

Only to the valley of that day.

The housecats never saw him again.
