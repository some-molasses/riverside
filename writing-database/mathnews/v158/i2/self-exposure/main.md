The day after I arrived in San Francisco, I went to the nearest bank to set up a bank account. The representative recommended against signing up for mailed billing; not for convenience nor environmental reasons, but instead because, in exact words, “why expose yourself to public?”

❦

“Public,” here, needs help. Certainly, San Francisco is not the wasteland that Fox News describes. Areas like Mission Bay, where Uber, Dropbox, Cisco, and the sprawling UCSF medical campus make their home, are no less safe than any street in Waterloo; they even have light rail to match. The harbourfront of Embarcadero, the sea lions of Fisherman’s Wharf, for that matter, the entire west of the city seems carefree. Live only in these areas, and you could convince yourself the City has nothing to worry about.

I don’t live in those areas.

In the City’s core — the Tenderloin, SoMa, and Mission — the consequences of the unaddressed triple crisis of homelessness, addictions, and untreated mental illness are self-evident. I’ve yet to make a morning commute without passing men left unconscious on the sidewalk. I live on a hillside; on the nearby stairway to descend the hill, several men the City will not house have set up tents spanning its width. I descend by road instead, I walk into a wafting cloud of urine, from those so City-forgotten, their only washroom is the streetcorner. I take care not to trip over the man asleep in the midafternoon sunlight, his only bed a cardboard sheet separating him from the cold earth. I pass a man with seven garbage bags attached to his grocery cart, itself filled to capacity with discarded glass bottles, the only chance at income the City provides. 

At the civic center, the City Hall rises above with majestic columns, grayscale stonework evoking the image of Rome, perhaps Panem. Atop a nearby planter, a man is splayed with eyes closed, mouth open, dead to the world. Further into the Tenderloin, first responders surround a man — Hey, you awake? — he’s upright, but doubled over with his hands tucked in his shoes. In the SoMa alleyways, more yellow vests kneel around unconscious men. I walk between Mission bus stops; in sixty seconds, I pass no less than five people doubled over in the fentanyl-afflicted way. I walk through streets checking every corner, ready to flee those the City has left so desperate, their self-preservation comes into conflict with mine. I tell a friend where I live, I hear that several of her friends have been mugged nearby.

I try one day to walk home from the train station. I take Google Maps’ most direct route — it takes me through the singular pedestrian path under a freeway; two hooded men block my only path in the early twilight shadows. I about-face to a detour route. There’s a pedestrian overpass across the freeway; a man is asleep against its iron-bar door. I take another detour route. I finally successfully cross the freeway, passing the Zuckerberg hospital as I do; another man rifles through trash on the nearby street; the Zuckerberg hospital would never take in a man made so unprofitable. 

At last I ascend my hill, hoping to follow an Uber driver’s unexpected warning: be home before dark. I never consider the stairway. It has been three weeks. No one has housed the stairway people. I cannot expect homelessness to be solved in three weeks, but for these men, the City has had ample time. 

One day, I walk past the Caltrain station. A woman with a grocery cart of all her possessions yells out:

Can you help me get food at Safeway?

Can you please help me get food at Safeway?

_Do you have an app that lets you help people?_

Why expose yourself to public?

The line has stuck with me ever since the man said it, with a knowing smile, like we were both members of some elite cabal beyond the street folk.

The problem is, I _am_ public.

It would be so easy to think otherwise. I’ve taken a Waymo autonomous car exactly once, for the first day of co-op. As the sun crested over distant Oakland, the pearl-coloured Jaguar arrived at my door. With algorithmically-perfected motion, the leather-lined Jaguar smoothly drives me to the train station, no sidewalks travelled, no men sidestepped. I board the electric train; it’s well-lit, with laptop tables and clean seats clearly targeting the tech commuter. I arrive at the office; it’s a luxury upscale complex far from the City, where none of “public” may enter. 

What west-side neighbourhood advocates might call safety, a Marxist might call alienation. With tech sector income, you’re easily able to replace grocery runs with Instacart, transit passes with Waymo subscriptions, even walks to the coffee shop with Uber calls. I have no app to help the Safeway woman, but I have so many to alienate myself from her. To relegate her to “public,” and pretend, like the bank teller, that her problems are not my own.

But there, but for the grace of God, go I.

What separates you from the alleyway fentanyl addict, hands tucked in his shoes? What makes you better? Choices? They stem from your background. Education, values, how you were raised? They stem from your parentage. Parentage, then?

That’s random luck. Trace the separation between yourself and the fentanyl addict back far enough, and all that really separates you is a twist of divine planning or quantum fate. That your consciousness sprouted in your body, and not his.

Had fate twisted differently, and I was him, I would want a world where I was not alienated as a thing to be “exposed to.” I would want a world where I was seen.

But it didn’t. In the life I got, height and perceived masculinity grant me the privilege to fear less than many. 

So I choose to walk to work each day, hoping not to disturb the addicts underfoot.
