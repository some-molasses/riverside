*[San Francisco’s harbourfront comes alive in the evening commute. Backpack-bearing office workers, AirPods in, journey home side-by-side with tourists wearing San Francisco sweaters and summer shorts. Hot dog carts line the numbered piers, historic streetcars lumber along the shore, and all languages fill the air. At the Ferry Building, commuters from around the Bay brush against each other in burgeoning crowds, each desperate to get home.*

*Hidden between the feet of two commuters at the San Francisco Ferry Building’s main entrance, appears to be a ground squirrel standing on its hind feet.]*

***NBC News interview with Dr. Miriam Singh, Ecology Professor at UCSF***

Unfortunately, we don’t research ground squirrel migratory patterns much anymore, ever since the squirrel lab was gutted by funding cuts. There’s not many squirrels to study here; very few remain within the city of San Francisco. Ever since they learned about the lingering ground contamination from Truman’s bioweapons, ground squirrels have become a very rare sight in San Francisco. I’d go so far as to say they don’t live here at all. Primarily, they congregate on the eastern shore: the island of Alameda hosts several thousands of them.

Could one have stowed itself aboard a ferry to cross the Bay? It’s not impossible.

***Mission Local interview with Vladimir, Kindergarten teacher***

You ask about squirrel? I saw squirrel. Many times. He is good runner. I go for pre-dinner run along the north coast. We run the same direction. I outrun him. I am good runner.

I go home. I put chicken in oven. While cooks, I go for run to mountaintop. He keep pace. We arrive at mountaintop. I see him dig hole. Bury seed. Patch hole. I run home.

I eat my chicken with three pepper flakes. After dinner? I go for run. I take metro to Mission. I run down Mission street. I am at my top speed. I have never run faster. I look to my side. Squirrel is running. Squirrel is outrunning me.

I fear. Fear for squirrel. Fear for myself.

*SF Muni Transit Alert:* Bus 1073 on the 14R owl bus has been cancelled due to an incident involving a ground squirrel. Despite our operators’ best efforts, we cannot get it to leave the bus. We are now attempting to follow the usual route to the Ferry Building, to see if it will disembark the bus at any point on its own. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

***TikTok interview with Brett, Student***

yeah man it was late when i saw it. late as shit. me n the bois were out drinking. im headed home, i was near the ferry building, and im walking by, and i see this fuckin rat absolutely zoom past me. but like. not a rat. shit was too big. too fast. im thinking: shit bro, i’ve found a new kind of rat. im gonna be rich.

so uh yeah i chase the rat. thing runs direct through the fence into the ferry terminal, and i cant see shit, so i slam my face into the fence. but it’s still running, and im not gonna give up this rat. fire creature, ill be loaded. so i start climbing. i get to the top of the fence, but then this wind comes out of fuckin nowhere, and next thing i know im on the ground and tasting blood.

but i look up, right? that rat. i see it at the end of the pier. there’s one of those late-night ferries going by, and it has those red lights on the side, and they’re the only lights in the area. they’re painting the place red. painting the rat red.

i look up, and in that red light, the rat has a paw outstretched, reaching. grasping. yearning for the ferry.
shit man, it’s a rat. it can’t reach that far. but shit. it wanted to.

***Mission Local interview with Lydia, Paramedic***

A security guard called us in. Apparently, someone had managed to hit their head on the inside of the fence of the Ferry Building. 

Sometimes we get calls about unconscious people, and when we get there, their pockets are turned inside-out. Looters, you know? Sometimes, we even see them when they arrive.

We get to the scene, the guard lets us into the gate, and I look at the body: male, 20s, signs of trauma, dressed for a party. He has this wristwatch, it catches glints of the traffic lights in the dark. And there’s a looter, hands on the watch, staring at it. But they’re not human hands. 

They’re squirrel paws.

I couldn’t tell if he was looking at himself in the reflection of its glass, or looking at the watch hands within. Maybe both. What I know is that when I knelt beside the patient, the squirrel turned to look at me. And I swear to you.

The thing smiled.
