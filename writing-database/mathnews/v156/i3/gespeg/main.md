Picture a Hall. Not a hall, but a Hall. Capital H. In my imagining, it's one well-maintained deep room, with black-clothed tables set throughout. The walls are soft white, there's few windows, but there's pictures instead: each one a wintry landscape—in some, there's even a deer. In one corner of the Hall stands a well-stocked fridge; above, the ceiling tiles are rectangular with light panels poorly hiding fluorescent tubes. You can book it through the Hall's modern website. They accept credit cards.

Let me tell you about the Hall in the land they call Gespe'g. 

When my family visited the Gaspé peninsula this year, we knew that before the Appalachians would set us free, we would have to visit the Hall. I’d never been, but in my father’s descriptions, it was legendary. The Hall, home of many a Gaspésian occasion. The Hall, backdrop of countless summer days. The Hall, the beating heart of the Atlantic coast. 

When the day comes, my family—mom, dad, uncle, and I—pack into a car and depart the beach town of Percé. With the ocean air cramming into our ears, we ascend a seventeen percent grade into the Appalachian mountains. Cresting a hill, we swerve, pass under a reddish rockwall one hundred metres high, climb another hill, dive into a valley of pines, and Percé, at last, sets us free.

Through level fields, we drive. Town after town pass us by, until we approach the town of the Hall. Yet, once there, all I find are empty shells, land where my grandfather’s general store once stood, and a gas station so old, it lacks self-serve. No legendary community heart. No Hall.

We drive still. Stores fade, replaced by lawns of unkempt wildgrass, old motels cozy and decaying, and isolated art galleries I’ll never fathom the viability of. With civilization fading behind us, we finally find the Hall. 

At the town's furthest edge, a brilliant chapel spire rises from the Earth, with a silver-plated roof to capture shards of the distant sun. Time-weathered displays paint its pointed windows, and metal crosses bind its solid doors to their frame. Nothing mars the chapel yard, save for an old graveyard, and a forgotten wooden barn. 

The barn’s only entrance is in the vertical middle of its two-storey wall. Amid sides of long-greyed wood, an uneven ramp of sun-baked planks reaches from the grass to meet it. Below, in its sealed lower level, shadows play among long-abandoned horse stables, withering in the dark. I was lucky we were here for the chapel Hall; we wouldn't be locked in with them.

The chapel was closed.

In the land they call Gespe’g, the Hall isn’t a building in the center of town. 

It’s not even the chapel on the outside of town.

It’s the old barn behind it.

Who walks with you? We had barely visited the Hall before our appointment came to leave it. Finally, we had to confront our reason for being there. My parents, my uncle, and I walk down the moss-encrusted ramp to the clearing path. At its end, the trees open to a grassy field, wherein stand a hundred vertical stones.

Who walks with you? We arrive at the cemetery, and amid the cars at its side, Ontario license plates shine lakefront blue. Some forty people gather at the entrance, some returning home, some who’d never left. Forty people, all of whom either answered the call to travel eighteen hours for a fifteen minute ceremony, or who heard about the passing of a grandfather who hadn’t lived in the Gaspé for almost fifty years, and still elected to attend. 

Who walks with you? We enter the cemetery, and within, a car awaits. Family sits in the backseat, people who had once invited my family into their home, now too ill to stand. Time stuns; how dare it caress this untouched place? How can the hands be so weak, that welcomed me into their home just one visit ago? We pass by stones engraved with the names of loved ones I've known. Our congregation grows in number, memory walks between us.

Who walks with you? We stop, and before us stands a knee-high gravestone. On its face, letters spell my family's shared name. Forty relatives gather, spirits fill the gaps among them, and my great-aunt holds my father and I closer than ever.

Who walks with you?

Home.

The ceremony is over in barely fifteen minutes. In ten minutes more, someone has made my father laugh. My great-aunt has let me out of her arms, and my mother and I search the cemetery for odd gravestones and unfortunate names. Soon, all attendees have driven back to the Hall, leaving my uncle, mom, dad, and I, to walk. 

In moments, we ascend the ramp into the Hall.

Polished wooden floors stretch the length of its single room; at its end, sunlight streams through the window into a white kitchen, stocked by relatives with plates of sandwiches, fruits, and desserts. Above them, a painted sign celebrates the Hall's hundred year anniversary: nineteen eighty-five. Tables pack the room wall-to-wall, each with white plastic tablecloths spread atop. Each one seats my family: those I’ve never known, those that raised me, those I’ve only heard tales of, all clustered into this single room in the chapel barn. And all around, wood-panel walls rise in pale yellow, a particular shade my grandmother’s family has used for generations that to this day, we paint the spaces we care about the most. 

Long before the arrival of the Europeans, the Mi’kmaq people called this land Gespe’g. In their language, the word means End. In that Hall, I could believe it. Heaven, in my estimation, is this. An old, pale yellow room, hand-constructed, with simple furnishings and homemade foods. Those I love cluster around every table, and laughter fills the air. My family is with me, sunlight streams through the windows, and outside, mountains and waves roll across the distant horizons.
