i am not religious

but in matthew 16:18, jesus says

> “on this rock I will build my church”

> > not provided: a framing diagram

> > not provided: a list of materials

the carpenter says “i will build my church”

> and to interpretation leaves the rest

in the mountain valleys of eastern québec

silver steeples can be seen

> radiant shards of the morning sun

> from untold miles away

each one identical, for we invented a pattern

> and named it:

> > doctrine

> it is our human invention

> it is the only way



[linebreak]

some defy it

in the mission district

> (san francisco)

an enormous steel frame

> of crosshatches polar quartz

> and a glass front facade

> > cleaned, pristine

seem to be a market, but name themselves: church

though i’ve never seen a service

> the front foyer holds the sign of a coffee bar

> > (in millennial tech typeface)

> and the second floor contains a sound system

> of which Modern Languages only dreams

> > (men sleep on nearby sidewalks)

at the corner of the altar

> a wanderer can find communion

> in prepackaged plastic

> > 15 mL of wine

> > 1 cm³ of bread

> the mass production process

> > ensures no germs are shared

some defy it

in the mission district

> (san francisco)

the chapel spire of la misión de san francisco de asís

> stands in a forgotten corner

> unremarked

but on mission street, wrinkled grandmothers sell pupusas

> (beside the food bank)

> broken bread and

wine is plentiful between the bars and taquerías

> (is it coincidence?)

> the district shares the chapel’s name

there is no chapel building

but at 22nd and mission, high above the roofline

> the sign of a skechers store scrapes the sky

> its steel support structure

> > rusting from years of use

> its faded paint

> > overlaid by an ambitious and gaudy graffiti tag

> > an artist challenged death

> > > to mark upon the blue

the steeple salespeople tell me

> a steeple is only to draw your eyes to heaven

and while there is no silver steeple

> each time i walk through the evening light

> the sketchers sign makes do

[linebreak]

is greater heaven found above it

> in unblemished sunset sky?

or is it amid the drug addict

> unconscious, just below
