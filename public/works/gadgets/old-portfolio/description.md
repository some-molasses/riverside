I have my full portfolio of JavaScript projects, dating back to 2017, uploaded at [https://some-molasses.github.io/](https://some-molasses.github.io/). 

Ideally, this would all be uploaded to the website you're currently on. Unfortunately, I have yet to have the time. The school semester - in particular, CS 452: Real-time Programming, has taken substantially more time than I expected it would. I'll continue to migrate projects over to this site as time allows.
