Picture this: it’s 9pm. You’re in Toronto for a company onsite. Hurricane Beryl’s last exhale has finally blown over the city, and you’re trying to reach an AirBnB you reserved online that, for all you know, might not even exist. Who can say without having seen it. It’s an easy ride along Line 2 to get there, but with the rain having let up, every building, every brick, every rail, every stone gains new depth.

As though for the entire city, someone had spellcast it into colour.

You end up walking for almost half the journey. Red neon signs shelter every kilometer as you turn away from the holes through which commuters come up for air. Stores shut as you pass, the city locks itself tightly, seeking small shelter before the day begins anew. Laughter rings out from the bars, and still, on lucky occasion, the nails of panting dogs click along the sidewalk tiles below. All the while, the blanket of the moon and stars settles over the landscape, casting the streetscape into shadow, hue, and memory.

The night grows too dark, and you take the subway. _You emerge into a cold, dark, and quiet street. Clueless as to your destination, you follow through the darkness until you’re brought to an open door. Through tight stairwells and carpeted floors of your grandparents’ time, you’re welcomed into the home of strangers. People you’ve never known. The incandescent golden light of the urban hearth hallows the cold exterior, and amid the unknown darkness, there’s safety._

You cross out from under the streetlight’s golden glow. Only your footsteps echo against the ground, disturbing the slumber of a city that never sleeps. A bird chirps goodnight, and the next subway rumbles beneath. Another wanderer emerges from the side street, leash in hand. You look down, _and understand why that golden space feels like home. In that space, the eyes of their dog stare back at you, infinite yet without secrets, they join with his smile of childlike joy. You pet hair softer than the fresh-fallen snow; though not peaceful, he’s peace-bringing all the same._

The wanderers pass by. You search the night for the sidestreet of your destination, and your eyes glance over the signs of darkened stores. A high-end school _you’d all made fun of the next morning_. A subway station containing trains _they tell you the dog loves to ride_. A pet supply store _you’d explored, all five of you, dog included_. _Each moment a glimpse of a stranger. Each moment the gift of trust._

All the while, your eyes search. A single glimpse of white fur, a single step of the people you’d so briefly known. The friends of a past time. Does it make sense? What would you even say? If you waved, would they even wave back? 

Is this, too, lost?

Eventually you make it to the AirBnB. It’s cozier than you could possibly imagine, a basement studio with a turquoise kitchen from a time when spacefaring was a dream that seeped into all things. You reconnect, self-actualize, respond to an email from a worried incoming first-year. The next morning, under the morning sun, you journey again. For all the journey’s mortar and grime, there’s nothing else like it. You breathe deeply of every second. Even of the frantic return trip to the AirBnB in the late afternoon to retrieve your forgotten jacket. Yet with all the completeness of the open road under your feet, your eyes search still.

Hurrying back to the train station, you pass by a cafe, _and hiding deep within from the morning light, you enjoy brunch like you’d not had in years. The four of you talk about the city, about the world. About those they see as instruments of oppression. Despite your efforts to be unconditionally agreeable to your overnight hosts, your words betray your disagreement without you even knowing it._

_“New queer or country queer?”, they asked about you after a moment’s pause. “Country”, your partner at the time responded for you. The conversation moved on._

_Minutes later, you would figure out what had happened. Days later, you’d still think about it. Weeks, months even, before you register the way anger had skipped the disagreement. Rebuttal, conflict, dropped to make room for background. For making time to understand you, despite your differences._

_For the empathy of someone good._

The GO train’s engines kick online, and the skyline accelerates past.

The moments of kindness remain.
