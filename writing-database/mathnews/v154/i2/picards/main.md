In Math Coffee & Donut’s lower shelves of the middle aisles, you may find several multicoloured packages of peanuts. Not just any peanuts. Picard’s Peanuts. This begs the question:

Which Picard’s peanuts are they? Not which peanuts, mind you. Which Picard?

It’s not so simple. While Jim Picard Sr. initially founded the Picard’s empire that stretches across Southwestern Ontario today, his empire has since split in two. Go to the towns of Windham, Morriston, Fonthill, Fort Erie, Woodstock, or Arva, and you’ll find an iconic blue shed displaying proudly their “The Original Picard’s” logo. Go to Talbotville, Niagara-on-the-lake, Waterdown, Vaughan, or St. Jacobs, and you’ll find more iconic blue sheds with logos claiming to be “The Original Picard’s.”

They are different logos. They are different Picard’s. In fact, the rebellious second faction doesn’t even outwardly display that they sell peanuts.

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SOUTHWESTERN ONTARIO PEANUT FEUD

In 1978, a Simcoe, Ontario man named Jim Picard Sr. was struck with a brilliant realization: if peanuts are so good, why not grow them here? The next year, he launched Picard’s Peanuts Ltd., pioneering peanut farming in Ontario.[1] About a decade later, the Picard family released their greatest hit: a potato chip covered peanut, coined the “Chip Nut.” Business boomed; while the empire grew to eight locations by 2012, the Picard family grew to include four children: Jim Picard Jr., John, Renee, and Brian.

But in 2012, the Picard succession plan fell apart. While Jim Picard Sr. and Jim Picard Jr. stuck to their roots, John and Renee Picard sought revolution, with dreams of manufacturing chocolates, various other nuts, ice cream, and a craft beer. They brought half the business under their wing as “Picard’s Foods;” with no particular geographic split, each half of the business evenly covers Southwestern Ontario. This split was not amicable. In 2015, each side of the family used their websites to take pot shots at the other, claiming that the opposing side was “fooling” customers or “stealing” their original recipes.[2] Both sides have been certain to work the phrase “The Original” into their branding, despite the validity of this claim. The peanut feud had begun.

In researching this article over the past month, the manufacturing process remained unclear: are both Picard’s still using the same farms? The same facilities? Has even manufacturing fallen victim to the feud? I took an unprecedented step in my mathNEWS journalistic career and emailed a primary source.

> Hello,

> Sorry, I know its confusing. There was a split in 2012, so different stores have different ownership, including different manufacturing facilities. You will notice small differences with the packaging, and flavour ranges.

## EXPEDITION: ST. JACOBS 

Sourcing Jim & Jim peanuts involved a simple car expedition to Arva, Ontario’s familiar store, containing peanuts, some chocolates, and assorted British candies.

Finding John & Renee peanuts, on the other hand, took your beloved reporter to the St. Jacobs peanut shed. Reaching the iconic blue building, you may do a double take when you realize that although the building is a Picard’s branch, nowhere on the outside is the word “Peanut” displayed. Over one third of its selection is peanuts.

Once inside, navigating their selection to find the Picard’s-famous Chip Nut was a challenge, given that they refuse to use the term “Chip Nut,” instead electing for “crispy potato chip covered peanuts.” They also offered several gift assortments, labelled the “Real Picard’s Gift Box” - the perfect gift for any family members deeply invested in the Picard’s feud. Significant shelf space was also dedicated to an assortment of Jesus-themed puzzles, a selection of sunglasses, more peace-and-jesus memorabilia, and several shelves of clothes for the Picard’s-adjacent Ramblin’ Road brewery. Jesus content. Brewery merch. Profit.

## PEANUT VERSUS PEANUT

With the peanuts acquired, I called upon the refined palettes of mathNEWS’s writership. In contest were two varieties of peanut:

- Jim & Jim’s Picard’s Peanuts - All Flavour Chip Nuts (1.33 ¢/gram)
- John & Renee’s Picard’s Foods - All Flavour Crispy Potato Chip Covered Peanuts (1.25 ¢/gram)

I went into the taste test expecting an overwhelming victory for Jim & Jim’s Chip Nuts, given their cohesive marketing and trust in their peanut offerings.

Not even one writer preferred Jim & Jim’s Picard’s Peanuts.

Points to both teams were given by _Not a N\*rd_ for the equal, perfect crunchiness provided in both variants of chip nut, as well as the overall taste being “surprisingly good.” _Lars Nootbar_, previously disposed against Picard’s Peanuts, described them as “not as bad as he remembers.” _no pun indented_ could not tell a difference between the two flavour blends, while \_\__init_\_\_ and _sexy_software_babe_ were disappointed in both peanuts for their audacity to taste like peanuts.

_Lars Nootbar_ likened Jim & Jim’s chip nuts to potato chips and John & Renee’s chip nuts to trail mix. _rockfacts_ gave unique bonuses to each peanut contender: while they preferred John & Renee’s smaller variety of peanut, they gave equal points to Jim & Jim’s peanut flavouring. _yummiPi_ was confident they could put either chip nut in a salad. I too am confident _yummiPi_ could put either chip nut in a salad.

From then on, it was a clean sweep for John & Renee Picard. All writers but two preferred Picard Foods’ revolutionary peanut. mathNEWS writers _aphf_, \_\__init_\_\_, and _sexy_software_babe_ found John & Renee to have the superior peanut flavouring blend, with _Not a N\*rd_ praising its salt content and better aftertaste. Several writers argued that on visuals alone, John & Renee’s peanuts are the stronger contender.

_Dick Smithers_, his Irish blood standing tall with the rebel Picard’s faction, set popcorn aside to pledge his unwavering conviction to John & Renee’s peanut revolution.

## CONCLUSIONS

With a sweeping victory for John & Renee, the implications are clear: Waterloo students are being served an inferior peanut. Although I am eternally grateful our wonderful MathSoc business manager has brought Picard’s peanuts to our shelves, I humbly request that she consider switching to the Picard Foods crispy potato chip covered peanuts.
