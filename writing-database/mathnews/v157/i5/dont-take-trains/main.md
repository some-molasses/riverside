When I first told mathNEWS writer _Glec_ that I intended to take the trains course, he, a past thorough enjoyer of the course, had the following advice: Don’t take trains. 

Don’t take trains. Trains is the course CS 452: Real-time programming. It’s one of the “Big Three” CS courses, arguably, the biggest among them. The highest challenge of Waterloo CS. Each term, sixty students start the course; after the first week, half or less remain. Trains tasks students with two major goals.

1. Develop a microkernel from scratch, in a freestanding C environment. No libraries to help you.
2. Use your microkernel to develop a multi-process controller for a Märklin model train set, orchestrating five separate trains to operate in simultaneous motion.

Don’t take trains. Consider the microkernel. Starting from nothing, you must implement multi-process context switching, inter-process message passing, caching and efficiency measurements, a multi-process rock-paper-scissors game, interrupt handling, and asynchronous I/O. You’ll regularly have to sift through _fourteen thousand_ pages of documentation to unblock your code, working through PDFs so big, every browser I tried failed to load them.

Don’t take trains. As of writing, this term’s victims have only just started the train controller. We’ll have to implement real-time train position tracking and estimation, multi-train convoys, and routing across several trains, all while avoiding inter-train collision. Did I mention the train sensors don’t tell you where the trains are? 

Don’t take trains. If each of these was its own course, good luck. Together in one course? _Fucked_. Consider that if your train control code breaks spontaneously, the potential problem surface is massive. Maybe your code is wrong, or _maybe_, the memory locations storing your code are being overwritten. Maybe you’ve mistyped a single line of your context switching code, and somehow it worked well enough to slip through the past assignment successfully, only to spontaneously break later. Both of these are _real problems_ encountered in the past week.

Don’t take trains. You don’t have the time. Assignment zero alone takes eighty hours minimum. You’re given one week. Every hour not spent in the lab is another hour up before the deadline, burning midnight oil in MC’s depths. 

Don’t take trains.

Don’t take trains, because in that first week, you and thirty others will be in the lab until 2 AM every night, battling the Märklin train set in hopes to be set free. Huddled around the small wooden tables, you slowly get to know people. Each time someone finishes their project, quiet cheers resound. A0 is individually completed, but the whole room is your team.

Don’t take trains. The late nights don’t stop. Weekends, reading week, they’re all passed in MC 3030. You join MC’s late night crew. You and CSC play a game of who goes to bed last. They almost always win. Each night, you’re alone on the sidewalks, so each night, you walk home playing music into the open air. 

Don’t take trains. Assignment 4 has you implement interrupt-driven I/O alongside a complete reimplementation of the eighty-hour Assignment 0, all in approximately one week. You work every day since returning halfway through reading week, and the night before the deadline, you’re still there. It’s 10:30 PM, the deadline is 9 AM, and eighteen of thirty classmates are in MC 3030. And we’re thriving.

Don’t take trains. At 10 PM, your classmate is using his valuable time to debug others’ code. At midnight, you get Flock Stop’s strongest tea, a companion in the moonlight. At 12:30 AM, you have to solve only one more bug. At 1:00 AM, a friend leaves to work _anywhere_ but the lab. At 3:00 AM, he bursts through the door to announce _I WANT TO DIE_. At 3:30 AM, you still only have to solve one more bug. It’s the seventh new bug. By 4:30 AM, only four people have left the lab for the night. Fourteen of thirty remain. The entire lab is increasingly styled in mid-hackathon dishevelment chic. You leave at 4:30 AM to get three hours of sleep before an 8:30 AM presentation. You return the next morning; at least ten people have pulled all-nighters. They have to present to the class at 10 AM.

Don’t take trains. At 11 AM, _befuddlED_ asks me: _Do you think you’ll regret this?_

The next night, on three hours of sleep, you take a bus—not a train—to London, Ontario. You check into a really sketchy AirBnB. And you run, shrouded in the midnight blanket, breathing winter air, to the downtown core. The Renaissance towers shine overhead, and the Thames runs below. You’re home.

You cross into London’s arena. Black eyeliner, spikes, leather, and frog hats fill the hallways and seats within. Three artists play. Winnetka Bowling League and Cavetown set the stage, with slow dances and sweet teeth.

Then Mother Mother, the main act, emerges. With black and red, electric guitars, laser lights, and artificial fog, Hell takes the crowd, and the cacaphony screams:

_GODDAMN, I LOVE TOO HARD, I LOVE TOO HOT, MY LOVE’S A FIRE_

_EVERYTHING I CLAIM TO LOVE’S GOING UP IN FLAMES AND I BURN ALIVE_

_I GOTTA LAY BACK IN A STRAIGHT JACKET AFTER SEX AND STILL INSPIRED_

_AND MY FRIENDS WILL ASK WHEN I FEEL RELAXED AND I SAY_

_WHEN I DIE (WHEN I DIE),_

_I’LL LET GO (I’LL LET GO)_

_BUT IN MY LIFE (IN MY LIFE),_

_**I’LL HOLD ON UNTIL THERE’S NOTHING LEFT TO HOLD**_

The walk back feels brighter.

_Glec_ always said “don’t take trains.” He then followed up on that. “If you hear my warning, and decide to take trains anyways, then you should take trains.”

Don’t take trains. It’s Hell. But, maybe you’re Hell too. Maybe, just maybe, you have the determination to do it. Maybe, you’re willing to reject every warning. Maybe, you’re willing to run along the tracks at the oncoming train, daring it not to move.

This is the best course I have ever taken.

Don’t take trains.
