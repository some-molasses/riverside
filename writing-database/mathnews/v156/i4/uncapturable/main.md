Packed into a car, looking out over Columbia Lake, the black sky didn’t look that different. Streetlights dotted the landscape, trees stood out against the ambient glow; it was just that above, the clouds didn’t look right. Somehow, they were slightly too stretched. Almost smeared against the above, and slightly green. Travelers stopped at intersections, pointing phone cameras at the stars. Seekers foraged into the Laurel Creek Conservation Area, and at the city’s northern edge, students clustered at the final intersection to watch the skies.

The Sun had sent home.

We drove, thirty minutes through dark hills and quiet corners, passing countless cars parked at the roadside, stargazers staking their claim to the beyond. Many parked along major arteries, but we wanted better. We found our safe spot at the side road labeled “Warning: Drive At Own Risk.” With a cornfield to our left, a harvested open plain to our right, we rumbled along a gravelled path until we found our spot to stop. Behind us, a few farms held silent vigil in the shadows, their warehouses and farmhouses distant boxes against the treelines. All that broke the night’s silence was barking dogs on the October air.

From our isolated side road, wispy cornstalks lined the base of our vision. Trees cast outlines against the distant void, and just above, the stars slept, forming a dark patch on the horizon save for the seven stars of the big dipper, framed in shadow, brilliant above the blowing corn.

Above, crowning the constellation, brushstrokes of faint lily and rose drew hues from the abyss beyond.

Everyone I’ve asked about it went home after that.

As I watch the sky, I keep seeing pale flashes. I look around, searching for a spotlight, a concert, something that could highlight the clouds so briefly. Nothing. Thirty minutes pass, all the while, I’m trying to figure out when I last saw an optometrist.

“Did you see that?” someone with me says. It happens again. And again. Flashes, patches of faintly brighter sky appear and disappear, each one present for only a second, before flying above our heads and beyond. To this day I don’t know what it was. A direct hit from the solar storm? A magnetic flare-up?

It doesn’t stop. With greater intensity, patches of faintly brighter light apparate across our vision, more large, more fast, more often. Each one spans massive swaths of the atmosphere – raise a hand before you as though to shield your eyes; each patch is about the area of sky hidden by your open palm. Some form in waves, traveling from the horizon to the zenith in world-encompassing curves, traveling hundreds of kilometers in a second, only to tangent away into distant space. Abyssal radiation glances off the planet at unfathomable speeds; magnetism shielding life below from the wails of the void beyond.

From our silent cornfield, we watched the magnetic field fight Ragnarok alone.

How do you respond to that? What do you say when the Gods come home?

We asked my friend if he had applied to grad schools yet.

--postscript--

He had not.
