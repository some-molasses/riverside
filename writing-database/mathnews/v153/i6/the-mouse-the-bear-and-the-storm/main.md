There had never been a mouse inside a great Arctic rainstorm. Mice are small, flimsy, and lack the fins or gills to allow them to swim proficiently, and should they try to stay out in a storm, they are sure to be swept away. This was to Mouse’s great dismay, who was ever an explorer in any other weather. When Owl told of the great coming rainstorm, Mouse was heartbroken that he could not see the storm himself. Bear often worked alone, but when he saw Mouse so dismayed, he resolved that he would change the world. He would show a mouse a storm.

Three days before the storm, while the other animals built safety and hunted meals under the last hours of sunlight, Bear’s weathered claws dug into the permafrost-shielded ground. The animals lived on the flattest part of the land turtle’s shell; when the stormwaters came, the icy plain would become flooded over, with all small creatures washed out to sea. With a mound of dirt free, Bear padded the dirt into a small hill, sure to crest above the floodwaters when the storm beckoned them to rise. Bear said to himself, “This is how I will keep Mouse dry.”

But as Bear lumbered home that day, he realized that water would come above as well as below. Mouse could not stay dry alone, yet so long as Bear could shield against the rain and the winds, Mouse could see the storm. Two days before the storm, Bear sought out tree branches under a boiling grey sky. He set them around his hill as supports, so he could lean in any direction from the hilltop and feel the Earth hold him upright. Bear said to himself, “This is how I will keep Mouse dry.”

But as Bear lumbered home that day, he realized that he had never seen underwater, and as his face fur got wet in the storm, he would be completely blind. On the last day before the storm, when the plains grew quiet and the skies grew dark, Bear ventured to the sea. From morning into twilight, he brought his head in and out of the water, each time opening his eyes wider. And when he could look into the depths, unafraid of the water, Bear said to himself, “This is how I will keep Mouse dry.”

Bear returned to the cave that evening, and only hours after he returned, the animals heard the rain begin. The other animals cowered, but Bear found Mouse peeking out from the cave entrance. “Come,” rumbled Bear. “I will show you the storm. I will keep you dry.”

Together, Mouse and Bear left the safety of the cave. With the rain building around them, they reached Bear’s hill, the branch supports around it sticking out as a crown. Mouse scampered up onto the hill, Bear stood firmly above him, and the two began to water.

In a growing chorus, the storm fell upon them. Rain fell in heavier and heavier sheets, and what had once been Bear’s hill became an island in a dark and unforgiving sea. Lightning crashed down to the plains around them, and where trees could once be seen in the far distance, only stumps remained. Winds screamed in their ears, as the sonorous beats of the Great Birds’ wings thundered across the land. But Mouse was dry. As the waters rose higher, from the dirt watchtower, Mouse looked out across their boiling waves as no other mouse ever had. As the winds grew stronger, safe under Bear who leaned against his branch supports, Mouse saw sheets of rain as no other mouse ever could. As the lightning grew more constant, Mouse looked to the sky to see brilliant green and purple magnetism intermix with lightning’s harsh strokes, drawing a canvas no other mouse would ever see.

Mouse could see the storm.

Crack. Mouse jumped, searching in the darkness only to see one of Bear’s supports snapped and swept away. Crack. Crack. With the first branch gone, more soon followed, snapping and sailing away until only Bear and Mouse remained. Both looked into the dark, and as the rain dampened for a brief moment, a web of lightning broke across the sky. Wings of electric light stretched as far as the eye could see, the aurora become feathers viridescent and rose, the moon and brightest star become a pair of eyes.

_SHELTER_, commanded the wings in the sky. The lightning vanished, and as its thunder arrived, a great gust of wind blasted Bear into the sea.

Mouse flew.

The hill was empty.

Bear’s head thrashed out from the floodwaters, and he clawed back atop his overlook. Mouse was gone. Bear searched the darkness, seeking some sign, a claw, a tail, any hint of a mouse. He submerged, and amid the rushing floods, a hint of fur shone out before disappearing out of sight. Bear charged, fighting the water’s current, each step a battle as he chased signs of Mouse along the flooded plain. Closer, closer he came, until he had Mouse within striking distance. Bear opened his jaw, and ripped Mouse from the waves.

Bear sprinted back to the cave, and with the other animals gathered around in shock, he coughed up water, ice, and a wet, saliva-coated mouse.

Mouse’s eyes shot open. The animals of the cave gathered around him; Elk directed animals to get food and warm leaves to nurse Mouse back to health. Soon, Mouse was carefully wrapped in leaves with berries aplenty to nurse upon. Hearing Mouse quietly chittering, Bear lumbered to the back of the cave. With a sigh, he dropped to the cave floor, lying his head flat against the stone. 

“I’m a failure.” thought Bear. “I couldn’t keep Mouse dry.”
