At the eastern tip of the Gaspé Peninsula lies the small town of Percé. Long ago, it was a bustling hub of the fishing industry, with lobster trapping vessels arriving daily and trains rushing through the trees. The fish have left now, and the train line has been washed out for years, but the town, and the rock for which it’s named, remain. Interested? Then pack your clothes, snacks, and the framed—

Percé, here we come!

## ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY…

From Waterloo to Percé is a sixteen-hour drive, and with the train line decommissioned, the quays shut, and the nearest airport hours away, that’s the best way to get there. It's best split into two days—day one: race down an empty Highway 407 at 7:00 AM, and don’t stop until you reach Québec City.

Day two: leaving the corridor. To begin, you have to drive until the end of the highway—truly an undreamt-of thing. Drive through the countryside for a little more, and you can stop at Mont-Joli to eat lunch on a coastal rock overlooking St. Lawrence’s ever-widening divide. A nice place to stop and think about—

Back on the road again! Next, you enter the Appalachian mountains in earnest. The path takes you through seaside town after seaside town, often along roads parallel with the waves: open seaway on one side, and on the other, rolling, slumbering primordial gods of red sandstone and shale. Earth, risen to meet the sky. 

It’s around the time that your Ontario-spoiled sense of scale starts to adjust that the road ahead takes a sharp upward turn. For the next three hours, you’ll trace a snaking, spaghetti-noodle line between the mountain slopes. The constant ups and downs become so common, your ears don’t have time to pop in a valley before you ascend the other side. My dad, a talkative driver, stops engaging in conversation around this stretch. I turn to see if everything’s okay, and past him, the ocean's level surface cuts across the window at a twenty degree angle. Not a time for distractions—

They level out! Finally, you pass the first sign. Grande-Vallée, GASPÉ.

Those not familiar with this journey won’t realize that the sign saying “you’re in Gaspé, the nearest city to Percé” means “fuck you, you’re not even close.” 

## GASPÉ, GASPÉ, GASPÉ

In the Gaspé Peninsula, they live in blissful ignorance of the concept of a municipality.

Kitchener Line enjoyers will be familiar with the towns of Acton and Georgetown, both of them stops between Guelph and Greater Toronto. I gladly stand by the argument that everything out to Mount Pleasant is Toronto, but I think it’s a stretch to try to argue that this extends to Acton and Georgetown. They’re obviously independent towns, neither Guelph nor Toronto.

The peninsula disagrees. Every isolated cluster of houses within thirty minutes of the city of Gaspé is, somehow, also Gaspé? You finally reach Gaspé, Gaspé and somehow, you’re still not in Gaspé. It takes another thirty minutes of driving through Gaspé (region), Gaspé (peninsula) to reach Gaspé (city), Gaspé (region), Gaspé (peninsula), and another thirty minutes to leave Gaspé, Gaspé. On the upside, the moment you’ve left Gaspé, Gaspé, you’re immediately in Percé. 

Some would say it’s the first sign things are different out here. The first—

Did I say you’re immediately in Percé? Just kidding. It takes another hour to drive to Percé, Percé. Didn’t you hear the local motto? It’s “fuck you, you’re not even close.”

## THE BEACH TOWN AT THE END OF THE WORLD

Imagine a nightmare-journey Gaspésian equivalent of Ontario’s Grand Bend. Welcome to Percé. When you reach it, there’s only one road, sidewalks lined with tourists from the fully-booked motels, hotels, and campsites calling Percé home. Good luck driving. Why don’t you want to slow—

You’ve made it! Want dinner? Every restaurant has a line. Every. One. Maybe you’d like to just drive to the nearest town instead? Fuck you again, Gaspé is an entire hour away, and the main road back to Gaspé is up a hill with an 18% grade. Why do you want to run—

Restaurants are out! Maybe you can just go to the grocery store? Percé only has one, behind a decaying barn, and it sells normal bell peppers for eighteen dollars a pound. None of this was unexpected—

Attractions! There’s a mountain to climb: about halfway up, they’ve installed a lookout point where they charge $15 / person just to walk on it. There’s a fifteen-metre hill they call Mont-Joli—that’s a capital M—with a massive white cross atop it, and there’s a charge to even approach it. They’ve closed off the stairs to the famous rock of Percé, and there’s someone demanding $10 just to take a picture of it. But we have memories from last—

What are you going to do? Leave? Really? Do you remember the drive? You’re at the tip of the peninsula, barred by a mountain on one side, water on the other, massive hills on every road, and that’s not mentioning the barely surmountable wall of Appalachians separating you from civilization. There’s no way out. You’re at the end of the—

But aren’t you happy? Isn’t this what we came for? Isn’t this why you set out—home is too far away to return anyway. Look at all these happy people—there’s nothing to worry about here—where do you want to—everyone is here—why do I feel so small? There’s no leaving now—is this what the lobster feels like—want to go to the rock? Shouldn’t we visit the stone—why are you so quiet—is this what the lobster feels like—look at all the souvenirs! Why is everyone so quiet—but the view is so gorgeous—I didn’t think it would be so soon—is this what the lobster feels like—

Percé! It’s been in the lobster trapping business for centuries.

Beyond the Appalachian wall, you’ve nowhere left to run.
