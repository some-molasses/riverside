I went on a tour of the Internet Archive a few days ago; a real, physical place that you can visit in San Francisco. When I went, there happened to be a conference on the same day. Not only did this mean that the founder of the Internet Archive was giving the tour, it also meant that they had a special visitor: an elderly man in the corner, hunched over a cane, whose wisps of long white hair hid a jovial smile.

They introduced him as the man who coined the term “hypertext.” 

That is, he’s the one responsible for the link.

I’m wasn’t always good at talking to people. For that matter, I’m still not convinced I’m good at it now. I’m far better than I used to be though, but to this day it feels like an intentional skill. An exercise, with component parts.

Every time I’ve taken the RAADS-R,[1] I’ve scored near-zero on every category except for social relatedness, which could nearly score me a diagnosis on its own. I can deal with textures, senses are fine, I’m not that fond of trains[2] or any other special interest, but unfamiliar conversation? eek.

To this day, trying to get into a conversation, trying to talk to people I don’t immediately connect with? It feels like swimming through a sea of peanut butter. Nothing works correctly, and every motion is stunted, restricted. Any success is a triumph.

It’s, in short, less easy than it feels like it should be.

The Internet Archive tour is incredibly cool. They show you their archival efforts, they play an old phonograph record, they show you the book scanning machine. They even take you to see a portion of the primary servers hosting the archive: a server stack against the back wall of a refurbished church, where their primary cooling mechanism is an opened window. To top it off, at the end of the tour they gave all the tour guests free ice cream. I’d stayed behind in their church hall / server room, and ended up at the back of the line.

With the elderly man with the cane.

There I stood in an ice cream line alongside the man who coined hypertext.

We talk a little bit. We get our ice cream. All the tour guests disperse. I go stare at a bookshelf. The man sits at a table, and while all the other tour guests have split into their groups of families and friends, the man with the cane is sitting at a table, alone.

If it was anyone else, or in any other context, I might have just gone home. But it’s, again, the man who coined hypertext. Further, for the past year I’d been going to Socratica events where they make all attendees promise that “If I see someone sitting alone, I will go be their friend.”

I suppose I had to try.

The very first sentence he said, I had to ask him to repeat because I didn’t catch it. Immediate low point. The peanut butter thickens. I asked “did you expect the current state of the internet,” to the man whose entire job was to predict the state of the internet. Another low point. The peanut butter turns nearly solid.

I kept trying though.

And he kept talking.

I learned all of the things anyone with a cursory understanding of that time would already have known. He told me about his friend Douglas Engelbart; about The Mother Of All Demos[3] where Engelbart demoed a fully-functional Google Doc to a world still seventeen years behind the first release of Windows. He taught me about ARPANET, and about the woman who realized that companies might have some interest in using such a system, and so added the top-level domain .com. These were probably things anyone could have learned from just reading his several books. Each time he had to explain basic events to me, basic components of his story, I worried I was offending him with my ignorance. The peanut butter only tightened.

But if you talk to someone long enough, the peanut butter will thin, and you can get at what really matters.

Eventually, we talked about his wedding. It’s far easier and quicker to get married in Marin County than it is in New Jersey, which is important if your friend’s health is in steady decline and you want him at your wedding.

We talked about getting old. Your speech starts to go at some point, no matter how eloquent you may have been earlier in life. It’s frustrating, but after a certain age, it’s better than being dead.

We talked about his family. About his father, roaming America in train cars he had questionable legal status to board. About his grandmother, accidentally becoming trapped on a coast guard vessel in the 1890s as it sought out smuggling vessels. About each, hearing the sounds of people dying; his father, hearing men be thrown from the trains; his grandmother, hearing smuggled Chinese labourers, chained both to each other and a giant metal weight, be cast into the ocean by their smugglers, chains attached.

Looking back, it was an odd thing to talk about. But these weren’t supposed to be the Ted Nelson story. They were just the stories he felt were worth passing on.

The peanut butter sensation had melted away by the end of the conversation. It’s never easy to get through, but it’s almost always worth it. Try. If the feeling is in any way familiar to you, I implore you: try.

I’ll keep trying. It let me sit with an old man named Ted, and hear stories from times I’ll never know.

  As an aside, peanut butter and molasses? Dream sandwich combination.
