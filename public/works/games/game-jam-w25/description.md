This is a game hastily thrown together in approximately four hours for the University of Waterloo's Winter 2025 Game Jam - theme: "cool down". 

In this game, two teams of players, taking turns at the same keyboard, must enter the names of a series of countries while racing against an ever-decreasing timer. Each time a team successfully enters a name, they will have a bit of extra time added to their countdown clock. The scoring algorithm is a tightly-guarded secret, but here's a hint: it has something to do with "cool" and "down."

This is not a guessing game. 

This is a list-all-the-countries-you-know-as-fast-as-possible game.

The first team to run out of time on their countdown clock loses.
