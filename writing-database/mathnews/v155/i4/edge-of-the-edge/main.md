Back before the sun decided it wanted to kill us all, some friends and I went on a walk to St. Jacobs Market. We went at it a bit lopsided though; instead of emerging by the market trail, we accidentally came to the edge of the city about a mile west of Weber street. There wasn’t any warning we had reached the edge; the suburbs kept going as usual until, suddenly, they stopped. Cornfield on one side, houses on the other. We stayed on the side of the houses. The renowned mathNEWS contributor, excellent friend, and Torontonian among our group, \_\_init\_\_, told us that for the longest time, they’d never realized that the city had an edge to it.

I think about that a lot.

I’m going to pose you a question. Think long and hard before you respond. It’s a subject of divisive, intense discourse among all walks of life: academics, politicians, students, scientists, family, and friends alike. Sit down before you read it. This is your last chance to turn back.

Still here?

Good.

Is there anything north of CLV?[1]

Unlike \_\_init\_\_, I’ve never been a Torontonian. I remain convinced that Richmond Hill is a made-up place, and Etobicoke is definitely just west Toronto. Worse, I’m actually not sure whether that second statement is controversial or not.

I grew up at the edge of the world. On the dividing line between urban infrastructure and the unassailable seas of verdant corn. But even then, just barely. The urban infrastructure was on the other side of an impassable river; we were the first outpost amid the cornfield. The edges of our world were on all sides, and easily found.

One of the most recent times I was home, I went for a walk to the furthest edge of the world. I’d discovered a long time back that there’s a trail you can take beyond the border of the suburban outpost, walking to the furthest edge of our sister town. The trail ends at the sister town’s westernmost highway. There’s a gated driveway to someone’s house on the other side, sure, but they wouldn’t appreciate tourists. There’s no footpaths to take beyond the westernmost highway. No escape.

In my mind, I’ve named it the edge of the edge of the world.

I don’t like letting important dates pass by uncelebrated. When the summer solstice came[2], I left my place about thirty minutes before sunset, and went for a walk towards Columbia Lake. The skies put all their best sunsets at Columbia Lake. By the time I had reached Columbia and Westmount though, Columbia Lake was in the opposite direction of the setting sun. I couldn’t turn away from the sun. It was the solstice.

In an unparalleled act of bravery, I crossed the road to CLV. It’s a nice area. Weirdly suburban. If it weren’t for the Waterloo-branded signs everywhere, you could almost forget you’re walking around a university residence. In positive news, I didn’t immediately die upon going north of Columbia. I’d never tested that before.

The sun did immediately set though.

I always thought CLV would be bigger. It’s surprisingly small. If you’re walking north and west to keep the cloud-covered sunset in view, you’ll cross through it much faster than you expect. Soon the sun is down. Soon the solstice is over. Soon you’re on the northern side of CLV.

They say the solstice is a time of new beginnings. On a planetary scale, it’s the beginning of a new phase to the cycle. It’s avoidable, but also undeniable.

‘They’ is me. I don’t think I’ve ever actually heard anyone say anything about the solstice. But if they did, I think I’d like them to call it a time of new beginnings. A time wherein you can look at things from a different angle. Turn the world in your hand, and see entire surfaces you’d never seen before.

We need those every once in a while.

Last time I was home, I walked to the edge of the edge of the world. Then I crossed the road to the other side. There’s a relief to it, a safety in the knowledge that you can get out. That the world exists on the other side. It’s on the other side of the road; you’ll return to it eventually, but for now, it’s there, and you’re here. Beyond the edge of the edge of the world.

Roads continue past the edge of the edge of the world. Cars still drive, deer still run. If you keep walking, you can make it to the next town. To the next edge. Then the next.

If you travel beyond the edge of the edge of the world, you may soon find a copper palace on the far side of an open field. At the palace's rear lies a tower, a rectangular obelisk some eight stories high, with a foyer at its base shaped like an artisan-cut jewel. In the night, light streamed out of its windows, bathing the neighbouring gardens in brilliant gold. From a distance, it is strikingly out of place. Acres of ponds and green fields, and at their furthest end, like it has been plucked from the sky and placed on Earth, an unmistakeable Camelot.

When the summer solstice is done, and you’re holding the world in your hands, you have the opportunity to turn it, to look at your world from a different view. Sometimes you’ll stop seeing old things. Sometimes you’ll see them still, but in a different light. Sometimes, you’ll be surprised by the new things you’ll see.

In that moment, you may just feel the most beautiful feeling in the world:

When the **_fuck_** did that get there?

--postscript--

1. Columbia Lake Village - the residence northwest of REV. West of MKV. West of V1. Really west of SLC. They actually decided to put students out there.
2. The summer solstice did not, in fact, come that day. I don't know how to read a calendar. It was the day before.
