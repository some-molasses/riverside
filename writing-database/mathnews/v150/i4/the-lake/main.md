Screams.

Astaroth would have lost track of time without them.  Their regularity helped him stay focused.  Presiding over the Pandemonic High Court of Appeal never required much mental effort.  The screams were the only thing keeping his heart in it.

They died out.  Astaroth pushed the oversized brimstone lever attached to his royal armrest back into position; with a great screeching, the round, vaulted courtroom’s central trapdoor slowly sealed out the brilliant glow of the Lake of Fire bubbling below, returning the chamber to its regular crimson shadow.  When the court’s cacophony finally fell to silence, the colossal cast iron doors to the chamber creaked open, revealing a small form, naught but a silhouette of a hunched man dwarfed against the outer chamber’s golden-orange light.  

NAME? rumbled the grizzled cyclops directing tonight's inquisitions.  

The man croaked out a name.

PROCEED.

With a gulp, the old man crept forward to the central trapdoor, and in a weak voice, pleaded.

“Sir, Mister Judge, sir, members of the jury, sirs, I think you’ve got the wrong man.  I’ve been a devout Catholic all my life, you see.  Was raised to respect God, prayed every night, always said Grace.  I did all the right things, and, and I just don’t see how I’ve ended up here.”

The courtroom fell to silence, and now Astaroth began to listen.  Soon it began.

_DID YOU… PRACTICE… LENT?_ groaned a rock-covered troll.

The man held his ground.  “Mister Troll, I promise you I did, sir.  Every year of my life.”

The courtroom fell silent.  A many-eyed beholder cried out,

_YOU ARE TATTOOED! _

The man met several of his eyes.  “I do sir, many tattoos, but all of them devoted to God, that’s condoned sir.”

The deals-demon, of course, saw this as a challenge.

_You’ve the eyes of a farmer.  Have you ever… mixed your crops?_

He had not.  On the inquisition went, grilling the old man on every small detail of the Big Book.  Astaroth zoned in and out of the conversation; the jury could be trusted to handle this themselves, they weren’t wrong often.  Finally,

_You did go to church, yes?_ inquired a green-skinned goblin.

“Yes ma’am, every Sunday we went to church, me and my dear Maria, even through the pandemic we were there in the online—”

Astaroth pulled the lever.  The trapdoor fell open.  Screams.

The man should have known.  The Lake would enjoy his bones, Astaroth was sure.

The jury’s celebratory cacophony drowned out the screams as the trapdoor slowly resealed.  Soon, the courtroom fell to silence again, and the next applicant was sent in.  A young woman stood before the court, and the inquisition began again.  

_Did you wash your hands before and after eating?_ cried out a pale banshee.  She had.

_Did you practice astrology?_ croaked a broad-winged drake.  She would never.

_Were you slothful?_ snarled a night hag.  She was not.  She told the jury of the many small businesses she founded, the organizations she assisted, the charitable work she did in life.  The woman was very proud.  Too proud.

Astaroth pulled the lever.  The trapdoor fell open.  Screams.

Astaroth didn’t revel in his work.  Some thought his work even harmful—on the street corners of Pandemonium, a collective of succubi had taken to preaching that the High Court of Appeal was becoming overzealous in its rejections.  They never gained much traction.

The courtroom reset, and the next applicant came in.  The young man started his argument before reaching the trapdoor.  The cyclops demanded that the man correct his mistake; he was kind enough to oblige.  He tried then to continue his opening argument.

Astaroth pulled the lever.  The trapdoor fell open.  Screams.

It was ultimately the chimeras who took up the succubi’s cause successfully.  Rather than lament about human suffering, the chimeras noted that primarily-pure souls committed to the Lake of Fire tainted its flames, eventually beginning to cool the Lakeside capital city of Pandemonium if too many pure souls were cast in.

The next applicant failed to get through his opening argument before using a High One’s name in vain.  

Astaroth pulled the lever.  The trapdoor fell open.  Screams.

With enough careful conversation and swaying of public opinion, soon even the greater demons had grown concerned with the rate of corruption of the Lake.  The archdemons accepted mass casualties to the Blood War every day, but danger to their own citadels in the capital they could not abide.  Lucifer had had no choice but to order Astaroth to address the concerns, lest he allow an uprising to emerge from the fear gripping the streets.

Another.  Astaroth pulled the lever.  The trapdoor fell open.  Screams.

Fifteen more years, Astaroth pleaded.  By 2035, he would rebuild the High Court to be more careful in its processing; it could be no sooner, the court was so stuck in its ways.  Even the banshees ceased wailing when they heard his commitment; all demons of pandemonium were satisfied, save for the chimeras’ incessant nattering about ‘delay’ and ‘not nearly enough to cool the lake.’  He ought to have them tossed into the Lake.

Astaroth pulled the lever.  Screams.

Did they have a point?  At the current rate, he was processing an average of one applicant every sixty seconds.  If he multiplied that by sixty seconds per minute, sixty minutes per hour, thirty-six hours per day, then weeks, then months?  

One more soul wouldn’t corrupt the lake.  Nor would two.  Nor three.  Why should the Lake be his concern anyway?

Astaroth pulled the lever.
