Almost a year ago now, I got to be the face of mathNEWS on live TV. I didn’t really expect to be on TV; I met a reporter for an interview near the erroring vending machine, but only when he pulled out the camera did I realize I was about to be git commit into the next broadcast. When they begin your interview for TV, they start with a lowball question. A kindergarten question. Yet for some in periods of change, a rather hard one.

_Please say your name, then spell it._

\(t=0\). Thursday evening. East Campus Hall. Game Dev Club. _Not a N*rd_ was giving an elaborate presentation on the topic of Undertale. I tried my best to focus, but on my laptop screen, I had the mathNEWS Discord server open, where we were, just a little bit, losing our minds. At 5 PM, _Dick Smithers_ began sending us pictures of the CTV nightly broadcast. CTV opened with a preview of the night’s stories; my interview there for all to see. Below it, the full name I gave.

\(t=1\). CTV posted the news segment online. We watched; a mathNEWS screenshot has been broadcasted to thousands of televisions throughout the region. Editors past and present gathered in the general chat, _labyrinth_ messaged “YOURE FAMOUS,” and I could see that for a moment, in a tiny corner of the world, it might be briefly true. It saw its jet engine streaking across the sky, while I waited on the ground for the subsequent roar to overcome my ears in three, two…

_Notification from Messenger. Parents Chat. Mom._

\(t=2\). _Not a N*rd_’s Undertale presentation concluded, and the roar had silenced. It was gone. Over a year of uncertainty, resolved in East Campus 5. We went to Mel’s after, and almost no one there knew. No one said anything. Only walking home later with tomatopotato did we coincidentally pass _god⚡peED_, who called from afar that he’s heard I’m “famous now.” It’s the first time the ramifications becomes real.

\(t=17\). Friday morning. The impact is still limited; sure, family members in KW saw the segment, but it hadn’t escaped KW. It’s fine. We’re fine.

\(t=20\). mathNEWS hits The Guardian.

\(t=25\). The story circulated. One-by-one, publications repeated the story. One-by-one, my five letters bounced around the world. I’d kicked a rock off the mountaintop, and every passing hour, more snow joined the avalanche. 

My partner at the time and I met in Toronto after work, and journeyed through the city of light. The weathered signs of Chinatown passed us by, one thousand colours in one thousand shadows. Neon signs hang above, shopfronts cram for space. We dodge into a restaurant, and talk about the unveiled secret; yet for twenty minutes of conversation, they didn’t realize what secret had been unveiled. They didn’t realize this was how my world found out.

In a Chinatown restaurant, someone for the first time fully understood. We left the restaurant into streets of slush, together listening to the timebomb’s ticks.

\(t=26\). We reached the Art Gallery of Ontario, its warm wooden walls like the familiar kitchen after a long journey home. People milled about, gentle music called from an evening concert deeper within. It was serenity. Comfort. For just a few hours, home. 

Just as peace was resettling, it happened again.

In that oaken front foyer, possibilities collapsed.

_Please say your name, then spell it._

It’s a kindergarten question. And yet, for too many years, a hard one. Was it the _they_ thing? More and more, I wonder if it was simple desire to set myself apart. To be a child no longer. To definitively say that from this point onwards, I am only my own. No gods. No masters. Only me.

A while ago, I changed my answer.

mathNEWS was one of the first places I did. It was among the first true places. MathSoc was another. I made myself a promise then: in every new space, I would go forward with my new answer. Slowly, I changed my world, and slowly, I’ve become stronger for it.

_Please say your name, then spell it._ I knew it would reach home. I knew my uncle’s mother-in-law would be watching the CTV broadcast, I knew she would call him over, and he would contact my parents, and the ruse would be up. But that promise, that golden promise. It could not be broken.

Five letters. Each one, cannonfire, ringing out a nail in a coffin of the alternative.

I visited friends the next night, almost all of them mathNEWS writers past and present. They all had followed the story, but no one knew that I’d done it under what was, to my family, a new name. When I told people that part later, most would ask “are you okay?” “how are you doing?” “holy _shit_, are you okay??” 

But I’d seen the messages.

> _Your uncle let us know you were on the news and we found the article! Good for you 🙂. You did it!_

> _Saw your news clip on the news just now. Well done. Love._

The secret to best all secrets, and in the end, it really wasn’t much of anything.

That night? I came back to Waterloo, and the world had changed. There were worlds in which it had changed for the worst. But this one?

In this one the die had been cast, and we came out on the other side, bursting to the seams not with loss, but incredulous laughter.

Thank you, mathNEWS, for helping me to keep the promise.
