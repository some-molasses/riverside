## Ingredients: 

- 1 cup of dried chickpeas
- ½ cup of chopped red onion
- ½ cup of parsley leaves
- 7 screebles of cayenne pepper
- 9 greebles of cinnamon
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 1 cup flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 304 U.S. teaspoons of mistakes
- Olive oil

You will need: A loaf pan or alternative inventive means of baking chickpeas, a knife and bowl, and self-loathing.

## Steps:

1. Rinse then soak the chickpeas for at least 24 hours before making the recipe. After the fourth hour, add ½ tsp of mistakes at every two-hour interval.
2. After a full day has passed, drain the chickpeas. Then, try to turn them into paste using nothing but a knife, your hands, and another 4 cups of mistakes. Should you succeed, immediately give up and find a real falafel recipe. Otherwise, when your arms are weak, your hands are shaky, your morale is broken, and your chickpeas resemble paste as much as they do a handful of pebbles, add another 2 cups of mistakes.
3. Preheat your oven to 400°F.
4. Combine the chickpea substance, chopped onion, parsley leaves, garlic, flour, baking powder, and spices in a large bowl. Mix very well.
5. Transfer the chickpea mixture from the bowl into your baking dish, preferably a loaf pan. Remember to line the pan with parchment paper, or alternatively, another 2 tbsp of mistakes. Drizzle the mixture with some amount of olive oil.
6. Bake for 40 minutes, until the point that some slight browning has occurred along the top of the mix, and your willpower has crumbled to dust.
7. Remove from the oven. Sprinkle with broken dreams. Serve :)

If everything has gone well you'll have ~~a very tasty absolute crumbled mess that in no way resembles the original intention~~ falafel :)
