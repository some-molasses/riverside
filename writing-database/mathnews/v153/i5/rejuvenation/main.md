You're in Toronto on an overcast November morning. You’re walking along Bloor Street when you find a cute little bookstore with an open door in three degree weather, and although you take a few steps beyond it, you’re inevitably pulled in. Inside, books in tight hallways rest on shelves stretching floor to ceiling without order or organization, the room so tightly packed it threatens to cave in on itself. The clerk, a bearded man who could have been a lumberjack had books not called him first, says to ask if you have any questions, and you don’t until you reach the back of the store and find stackable containers in an unreachable corner, floor to ceiling, each filled overflowing with multicoloured Lego bricks. You walk back to the desk, dodging the Lego shelves you didn’t see before, rotating around the Lego aisle endcap and its Lego signage to ask the man: what’s with all the Lego, hidden among the dusty books but so bright once you’ve seen it. And as he tells you, you look down.

His desk is made of Lego.

A wise man told me years ago that “if you’re bored, you’re boring.” I haven’t found him to be wrong yet.

You keep walking down Bloor. You’re in Koreatown now, but you’re not from Korea, and you’re not really from a town either, so you’re not only out of your element, but you also can’t read for shit. But the winter air is clear, and as you take in the sights—the “magic health” stores selling weight loss and laptop repairs beside the corner grocery markets with tomatoes piled under the winter sun—you find a familiar park. You detour in; the relatively small Christie Pits park has only a few softball diamonds and playgrounds, but though it’s unremarkable, you’ve heard the warning of its history every day of your life, every time the Tragically Hip etched the park’s race riot of “that night in Toronto” into odious legend. You tread across this birthplace of old hate, years of history underfoot. 

You're amazed, because you never meant to be there at all.

One of the best parts about living in Waterloo is that you don’t have to live in Waterloo. Yes, your bed is here, you generally return here each night, but that’s not completely restrictive of what you do in the day. You can start your day in Waterloo, go almost anywhere in the GTA for lunch, and return to Waterloo at night without anyone having to know. 

Once every few months, I get the feeling I’m not using that ability enough.

You eventually reach High Park, the destination you had been searching for; your task is complete. It’s not your first time in a forest, but there’s something different about this forest, its colossal trees and untamed valleys, that leaves you intimately aware of its age. You walk along the leafy paths as the trees whisper shadows of days before, of many lives lived under their ancient watch. You journey further into the trees, and on the path before you, a golden lab in a strawberry bowtie guards the path beyond. You lock eyes. She runs away. You follow her, as you do, the trees part to reveal a sandy hill populated only by dogs, running and playing in every direction.

Out of nowhere, a black lab lovingly tries to tackle you to the ground.

I had a free weekend coming up, and not a single plan for it, save for doomscrolling Instagram and aimlessly exploring Starfield until Monday morning rose. It was Remembrance Day weekend, so I’d try to break it up by going to the cenotaph ceremony.

There’s a cenotaph in Toronto, right? To get there on time, I’d need to wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday. But I’m not doing anything else, and I can sleep on the train. The ceremony would be done by noon, but High Park is right there; why not explore? If I am to be bored, it will only be because I have rejected the vastness of life for isolated decay. If decay is the alternative, why not choose rejuvenation? If death is the alternative, why not choose life?

I buy the GO Transit day pass.

You’re not at High Park yet, and after detouring through Christie Pits, you desperately need lunch. You pass many places offering food, but none feel quite right, not quite replenishing of the body and soul, until you find a poorly-marked shawarma restaurant. It offers “East African Cousine.” So you walk in, into a restaurant with a haphazard menu and a single TV stuck to unbranded brown walls, and you order your shawarma wrap from a man who seems confused you that you're in his restaurant at all. You sit down, out of place, unsure where you are, less sure where you should be.

And here you are. You’re who knows where along Bloor St, your destination either near ahead or long behind, you cannot tell. You’re a lost Waterloo refugee, in the heart of a community that isn't yours, with decorations on the walls in a script you cannot parse, watching a soccer game on the muted TV between teams only you don't recognize in a language only you don’t understand. And you know just one thing:

You’re not bored. You're more alive than ever.
