it’s not the totality.

it’s not the black dot inverted of the sun, nor the frosted crown encircling the moon. 

it’s neither the faint cold that takes rest upon your skin, nor the odd calm that 

> seems to muffle the sounds of main street, bustling moments ago.

it’s not the way you hold close to your friends, like danger lies in moonshadow.

it’s not the way your lungs can’t quite fill, whether that be from excitement, or from fear.

it’s not the radiation-yellow sky on the western horizon. it’s not the canvas in the clouds, not the pairing of daylight and midnight colours:

>	impossibility made real.

it’s not the aimless firefighters, awaiting outside the firehall the quiet of the eternal flame.

it’s not even the crackle of fireworks, jealous in the distance.

[linebreak]

it’s not the ghostly light emanating from the clouds.

> nor the sorcerer’s eye peering in.

> the piercing gaze of the omnipotent.

[linebreak]

it’s the way that five minutes later,

you’re walking down Highway 20, Pelham, Ontario

diesel-guzzling pickups storm through the nearby intersection

tim hortons and gas stations and pizza restaurants passing by

the firefighters have gone back inside

and when you look at your feet

discarded water bottles and paper scraps line the sidewalks

you haven’t really moved

but the universe is satisfied

and the moment has moved on
