I’ve been thinking about this article for a while. There were two versions of it: this one, and the overdramatic version that only applies if you never come back.

This recipe isn’t a family recipe; it has no storied history, nor legends of being pulled from the clutches of oppression. It is entirely homegrown — the ingredients are all shared between St. Jacobs and the local T&T. I derived the recipe from a few online blogs, but for the most part it has come from a few seasons of experimentation and creativity only unlocked by finally living free. It is unique to this town, this home to which we always return.

And it sounds like you will.

Most recipes for tomato soup online require an assortment of canned tomatoes, diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and every other tomato format short of ketchup. I didn’t really have the patience for that; Tomato soup should really only require one core ingredient: tomato. Sometimes, simpler is better.

So I'll try not to make this too long.

Feel free to add the additional tomatostuffs back in if you feel there is something missing.

Like a student concert without you there.

### Important things to have

- Around 8 small tomatoes, 4 medium tomatoes, or 2-3 really big tomatoes
- 2 cups of chicken broth
- \(p\) carrots
- \(q\) cloves of garlic
- 1 slice of an onion
- 1 block of ramen noodles
- A large pot

### Recommendations:

- Spices, especially black pepper
- A small dash of sesame oil
- 3 tbsp of Parmesan cheese
- Around ¼ cup of chopped parsley

Start by boiling the chicken broth and 2 cups of water in a large pot, and cut up all your tomatoes into small chunks. If you have a blender, feel free to blend the tomatoes to make that step easier. When the water comes to a boil, turn the burner down to medium-low, add your tomatoes, and start a timer for about 20–25 minutes. Stir occasionally, then cover the pot, taking a last look at your intact tomatoes and saying goodbye.

When there’s a recognizable chance of goodbyes being extended, or final, it’s hard to find the words that fit.

While the soup is cooking, chop up some cloves of garlic to taste and sprinkle them in. Chop up one slice of an onion, and chop or julienne a few carrots, adding them to the pot as you go. Add salt and spices according to taste: I’ve had luck with black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon, but any \(n\) spices from your cupboard are sure to work. This is also generally the point where I’ll add a dash of sesame oil — not much, lest it overwhelms the taste.

Maybe I would have used more, but you were convincing when you said you’d be fine.

After about 12 minutes, the tomato chunks should have started to melt into the soup. Squish any large tomato chunks with your utensil of choice to help them along the way, but let the soup continue to cook for its full duration. Once you’ve determined that the tomato is almost fully combined with the soup, add in any cheese and parsley you’d like. If adding noodles, drop in the block of noodles like a raft on the ocean and send it away.

I hope you remain safe and sound in your travels across the sea.

After letting the noodles cook for about 2–3 minutes, serve. Makes about 2–3 meals, but you can always think about changing the proportions.

And I look forward to the day we all meet again.
