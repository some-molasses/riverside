it’s called sinusoidal soup because it makes your sinuses go “oi” immediately before experiencing the entire range of heat to cold at once. It’s a bit like

\\\[  
\\text{very hot} \+ \\text{very cold} \= \\text{very hot} \+ \\text{very $\\neg$hot} \= \\text{very}  
\\\]

strongly recommended if you ever feel like clearing out your entire head.
