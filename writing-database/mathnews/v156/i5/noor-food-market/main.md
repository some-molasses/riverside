On Erb St W, halfway between University Ave and Fischer-Hallman, there’s an unremarkable one-story plaza you’ve probably passed before. Made of black siding above red bricks, it contains simple essentials: a variety store, a hair salon, an insurance agent, and more. It also contains two shops, signs of bright orange above their door: Noor Food Market, and Noor Food Market (again). 

They’re the best Noor Food Markets this city has ever seen.

## AN IMPERFECT GROCERY STORE

There’s a lot that’s bizarre about Noor Food Market. For one, whose idea was it to make two of them? To get the full Noor Food Market experience, you have to enter one store, get your groceries, go through the checkout, then walk outside, down the sidewalk, just to enter the second Noor Food Market. Topping it off? Between Noor Food Market and Noor Food Market Two, there’s a random pharmacy third wheeling.

This pharmacy amuses me to no end. How did it end up between two Noor Food Markets? Who came first? Do they talk? Is it like being in a car’s middle seat? Is the pharmacist the middle child? I want answers.

There’s more inside. Given the small space, they only have one cash register. Last year, it was by the front window, creating a clear traffic flow around the perimeter of the store. 

Since then, they’ve reorganized the store to make it… worse? You walk in, and the end of the checkout is immediately in front of you, putting your footpath directly in conflict with those trying to pay. You pick up your basket from the lane’s end, but to get to the produce, you have to dance around people that were previously hidden away. 

At least it feels cozy inside? That’s primarily because of the wood floors they have. Can you recall ever seeing wood floors in a grocery store? I’m reasonably certain it’s actually vinyl - still, who chooses the wood pattern for their grocery store? Loblaw would never. I can’t overstate the coziness though; the auditory experience doesn’t exist. They’ve outsmarted Mariah Carey by simply playing no music, ever. The sound of their door chime is etched into my mind; the whole time you’re in the store, you’re intensely aware of everyone around you, because amid the freezer array hum, you can hear everything they do. 

I love that.

## NOOR FOOD, MARKETED 

Noor Food Market (the first)’s small scale limits how much they can sell, but they still have most of the essentials. They have only one small freezer in the back full of produce, but do you really need more? What more is there beyond tomatoes, apples, carrots, onions, potatoes, and garlic anyway? 

The answer is dates. At least twenty-two varieties of them. I don’t think T&T even stocks dates, and all the other big chains only ever stock the one brand, on occasion, hidden in some dark corner. Not Noor Food Market. Every type of date you can dream of, they have in stock. They even stock a date bread—like a hybrid between a donut and a soft bagel, formed of chain-link sections with dates at their cores. It’s revolutionary. I once brought some on the one hundred twenty kilometer journey home just to give my mom and dad the chance to try it.

They stock bread too of course - not boring, price-fixed European bread, but varieties upon varieties of naan. At this point I’ve just stopped eating European bread—when the ancient Greeks theologians described the “nectar of the gods,” I imagine they were thinking about grilled cheese on naan loaves. 

All this, and I’ve not mentioned the best part. It’s cheaper than Loblaw. By a lot. Comparing pictures I took of Noor Food Market pricing to the prices Zehrs, T&T, and Walmart list online, Noor Food Market was cheaper on average than all of them.[1]

## THE SECRET TO CHEAPER FOOD

The last time I talked to a mathNEWS writer about my beloved local food market, they wouldn’t have any of it. They maintained that they would prefer to eat food that was, quote, “not mouldy.”

And… fair. I guess. You’d have to be blind to think that Noor Food Market produce is of the same grade as chain store produce. Whereas Zehrs sells only the top of the line, Extra Fancy, plastic-shine apples, Noor’s are distinctly more banged-up. The onions are often ugly, and the tomatoes are sometimes softer than usual. My theory is that they stock the lower-grade produce Loblaw doesn’t go for - all the food that wasn’t good enough for rich suburbia.

In one line, that is what I love about Noor Food Market. We exist in this world of perfection. We joke about Cali or Bust, but it comes from the need to be the best. To be perfect. Every week, sometimes every day, one of us makes a r/uwaterloo post about not being able to meet their stratospheric expectations. We push our heads against the grindstone, we test our limits every term, because if you can’t run five clubs and play on three sports teams, what are you doing with your life? If you can’t make the top co-ops, are you wasting your chance? If you can’t do five courses a term, if you can’t ace every midterm, if you can’t maintain your GPA, what the fuck’s the point? 

The point is to try. Not to be perfect. Not to reach some unattainable standard, neither to be flawless nor without challenge. Simply enough. A human, doing their best. Behind every flaw of Noor Food Market is a human that tried. Maybe they’re not doing perfectly, maybe they could use a bit more music, but the lack thereof shows that a human forgot. Not an algorithm, not a verticalized business process nor a committee. Just someone like us. 

In the end, I don’t mind if the tomatoes are a bit mushy. It makes for better soup.

--postscript--

1. I found Zehrs, T&T, and Walmart to be 31.34%, 24.41%, and 22.30% more expensive per pound of produce on average. My data collection methods were probably super flawed though, so take those metrics with an entire soup ladle of salt.
