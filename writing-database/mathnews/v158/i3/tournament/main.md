In 2016, Ubisoft released _Watch Dogs 2_, a video game set in the San Francisco Bay Area, featuring a minigame called ScoutX. In the game, players take pictures of famous landmarks from real life that have been represented in-game. 

Are they better in-game? I endeavoured to find out.

## THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

Let’s start with the most iconic landmark. Hot take: the Golden Gate Bridge is not that impressive unless you’re standing on it. It’s cool, but can regular visitors climb the towers? Can we graffiti its heights? Can we get pictures of it without accidentally stumbling into nudist beaches?

Marcus Holloway can. I cannot. _Watch Dogs 2_ does it better.

**Best clothed beaches:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## LOMBARD STREET

_Watch Dogs 2_ wins again. Marcus Holloway has a quadcopter, a third-person point of view, and a distinct lack of physical pain preceptors; combined, they make the experience of the city’s second-crookedest street far more enjoyable. When you’re on it in person, it’s really just “Oh Fuck Another 27% Incline.” You can’t see the curves; you’re too close to the ground to really see much of anything. What you need to get the most out of Lombard Street is a third-person camera, but how are you supposed to do that? You’re not Marcus. 

**Best visibility:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## PEACE PAGODA

It was under construction.

Shoutout to the poetry night I went to near here with a bunch of total strangers. Thanks for not serial killing me xoxo.

**Best accessibility:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## UBISOFT SAN FRANCISCO

Ubisoft decided to self-insert their local office into _Watch Dogs 2_, even making it the setpiece for a mission.

In real life, it’s been closed for six months. The only hint it was ever there is the “UBISOFT” imprint where the main door’s sign used to be.

**Best state of the games industry:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## COIT TOWER

Every time I see this tower, I think “wow it’s the tower from _Watch Dogs 2_.” For that matter, the entire northwest of the city is reasonably 1:1 with _Watch Dogs 2_. It’s really impressive that they built San Francisco to match _Watch Dogs 2_ so well; I do love the source material though, which means _Watch Dogs 2_ wins again.

**Best original concept:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## FISHERMAN’S WHARF CRAB STATUE

There was no way I was going to notice this if it wasn’t in _Watch Dogs 2_. _Watch Dogs 2_ places a Maman-sized crab sculpture at the front entrance to the city’s most touristy pier; a steel monument of epic proportions. In reality, the crab statue does exist! It is however much smaller than in _Watch Dogs 2_. Definitely recommend visiting this one in _Watch Dogs 2_.

**Best evolutionary final form:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## RANDOM FISHNET LEGS IN HAIGHT-ASHBURY

“holy shit, it’s the fishnet legs from _Watch Dogs 2_ are real???” – me a couple weeks ago

To be clear, not all ScoutX locations are. Some have since been deconstructed, like the shoe garden, and some are just made up to showcase the overall culture, like particular murals or shops. To discover that there is in fact a pair of massive fishnet-wearing legs coming out of a second-story window for some reason? Insane. Massive credit to _Watch Dogs 2_ for drawing my eyes to this one.

**Best fish:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## MURPHY WINDMILL

Look I’m not sure there’s much value in visiting this one in either representation, but I really wouldn’t have bothered to see it if it weren’t “the windmill from _Watch Dogs 2_.”

**Best?? wind???:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## PIER 39 SEA LIONS

I really thought this was another funny thing they’d made up to illustrate culture. In _Watch Dogs 2_, you can visit a plethora of sea lions, hanging out on floating pallets just outside Pier 39. Video games are allowed to have creatures permanently in one part of the map; it’s not like the player expects things to be perfect.

it’s real. they just do that. What are they doing here??? Why is permanent habitat a bunch of wooden pallets??? Are they stupid??

Consider though that seeing them IRL requires you fly to San Francisco, whereas in _Watch Dogs 2_, you can do it from Waterloo. 

**Best glitches for price:** _Watch Dogs 2_

## PALACE OF FINE ARTS

While _Watch Dogs 2_ includes the Palace of Fine Arts, it does nothing to convey the sheer scale of this remnant gateway into the 1915 World’s Fair. The real-life structure is 49 metres tall, but I can’t imagine the _Watch Dogs 2_ version to be any more than twenty. It lacks the majesty, the weight, the impossibility of such an intricate stone palace in the United States of America, built and maintained without profit incentive.

I’m not saying San Francisco did it better though. Walking through it, I felt an incredible deja vu. I hadn’t been here before, but I’d fought for the Grand Army of the Republic in _Star Wars: Battlefront II_ countless times, battling droids through the streets of Theed, capital city of Naboo. What’s Theed based on? This very structure. Clearly, _Star Wars: Battlefront II_ did it best.

**Best Naboo:** _Watch Dogs 2_ et al.

## SUTRO TOWER

To _Watch Dogs 2_’s credit, they get the shape of Sutro Tower pretty dead-on. 

They miss the spirit. At the poetry night I didn’t get serial killed at, someone referred to Sutro Tower only as “The Structure.” It needed no other introduction. Walking around San Francisco, Sutro Tower is almost always there. Look to the skechers steeple at 22nd and Mission (mathNEWS 158.1): you’ll find Sutro Tower watches above.

A man quoted in _Civilization VI_ states that “a man on a horse is spiritually, as well as physically, bigger than a man on foot;” I wonder if the same applies to Sutro Tower. It’s not on a horse, but it is on a mountain. It’s functionally equivalent. It makes it something more.

It may only be a tower on a hill, but I know he will keep us safe.
