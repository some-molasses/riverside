Ten years ago, London, Ontario developer Digital Extremes released a new character for their studio-defining sci-fi title, Warframe: Equinox, a quiet, composed ninja robot[1] defined by balance. Choral music followed her footsteps, as players paired her with kunai, shurikens, and finely-crafted bows to defeat hordes of gruesome far-future opponents.

Return to the game now, and you’ll be greeted by Digital Extremes’ newest update: Warframe: 1999. In it, you’re suddenly playing a half-human half-warframe hybrid, screaming down European streets on a diesel-chugging motorcycle with an AK-47 strapped to your back, navigating a world transformed by Y2K-turned-tech-zombie-apocalypse. The choir has been shot, their music replaced by Nine Inch Nails; the aliens have vanished, replaced by zombified CRT television sets; balance is moot, and violence is now.

Outside observers might say the game has lost its way.

They’re incredibly right. It’s a good thing.

Beware spoilers.

## THE LITH ERA: SILENT HARMONIES 

Before 1999, Warframe was strictly set in the distant future. Taking place throughout our solar system, the player controls an assortment of superpowered ninja-like robots—known as warframes—battling against twin capitalist and communist galactic empires, at speeds of hundreds of slain enemies a minute. Quests were simple: go here, kill things, defeat captains. Themes? Stories? What are you talking about? Go impale bad guys.

Back before the past ten years of content updates, high-level Warframe gameplay was defined by Void Farming. Your team would repeatedly run the hardest mission available: an endless survival against the backdrop of an ancient empire’s ivory-and-gold palaces. Wisps of white energy trailed up from the gilded floors, ninja-like players shot silent arrows into alien foes, and choral music haunted the halls.

Y2K, at the time, did not.

## THE MESO ERA: VOICES AND CHARACTER

You can only run endless missions in white-walled palaces for so long. Warframe had to grow. Digital Extremes had started hosting yearly Warframe conventions in London, Ontario – each year, gaming influencers from the world over descended on London for one weekend[2]. Each year, Digital Extremes needed massive, flashy new content to showcase to justify the trip. After all, it’s London.

Justifications came. The robots gained personality: the lineup of glossy space ninjas was augmented by a monkey king, a fairy queen, a sea captain, and a synthwave DJ. Why kill enemies with a sword? Now, you can use Darude: Sandstorm to bleed their ears to death.[3] 

Flashier content came. Warframe added open worlds, from Earthen plains. to Venusian iceflats[4], to the zombified husk of a Martian moon. New music followed. With the release of the Venusian iceflats, Digital Extremes ventured into English-language songs, releasing We All Lift Together, a chain-gang anthem of indentured cybernetic slaves dreaming of freedom. I still sing it when walking home in the snow.

Gone were the days of silent androids and ivory halls. Character had come to rule.

## THE NEO ERA: FIRST GLIMPSES OF TAU

Digital Extremes was not yet satisfied. Rather than continue to add reasonable expansions, more open worlds, more galactic conflict, they began to swing for the fences. 

In 2021, Digital Extremes released their long-awaited expansion The New War, closing off the past ten years of storytelling and leaving a clean slate. Where did the high-octane, sci-fi robot looter-shooter go next?

They released a souls-like gamemode[5] featuring a pegasus-riding samurai.

Instead of the mach-speed flamethrower-wielding robots players were familiar with, players now had to maneuver the careful sword strikes of a vulnerable, lone human. Familiar gameplay? Who needs it? Through the new dreamscape setting, Digital Extremes told a new story. Was it of galactic struggle? Of space warriors shooting their path to victory?

It was a story of breaking the cycle of depression.

They kept going. Eight months later, Digital Extremes released a new quest, pitting the space ninja robots against an eldritch god. In its last moments, the players take control of a titanic statue, steeling themselves for a Pacific Rim humans-vs-Kaiju battle. How does the statue fare against the raging eldritch god?

It takes the god’s face into its hands, and reads it a love letter.

Digital Extremes would not relent. As players prepared for Warframe: 1999, they released one last questline, where the player character tracks down and cares for someone suffering from a mystery ailment. Near its end, you play a osu!-like rhythm minigame to assist the character in their pain. Only when the character dies, and a newborn is taken from their deathbed, do you realize the minigame’s nature.

Contractions. They made a dying mother’s contractions into a rhythm game.

## THE AXI ERA: NINE INCH NAILS MEETS THE POWER OF LOVE   

In December 2024, Digital Extremes released Warframe: 1999. Contents include a new set of playable maps set in the cityscapes of Earth, 1999. The Warframes have cast aside their bows and moth wings, now sporting AK-47s atop diesel-fueled motorcycles. Begone galactic soldiers; techrot zombies with CRT televisions for heads rush the player en masse. Away with the choir; missions are set to the electric edge of metal ambience and Nine Inch Nails. In the expansion’s first hours, players time travel, attempt to save the world, and fail horribly. From that point on, players’ key quest is to have daily conversations with each of the six new NPCs to befriend and even enamour them, in Warframe’s, a looter shooter’s, most widely-beloved piece of new content yet: 

A dating sim.

Showcasing the Warframe of today to twelve-year-old me, logging into the game for the first few times, would be akin to giving a ghost pepper to a Victorian child. It is so dramatically different. Yet, it is also the same. Despite the difference in visuals, the core gameplay, plot, and theme remains.

What is a space ninja? Perhaps it is not only a stealthy warrior in the depths of space. Perhaps a ninja is simply someone willing to take unconventional approaches. To reach for nearby galaxies when this one would do fine. In this way, Warframe is Digital Extremes’ self-insert. Consistently, they take the most unconventional options, and consistently, they blow us away.

Seriously. Dying contractions. Rhythm game. Who does that?

--postscript--

1. Technically they’re almost entirely organic material transformed by the Helminth strain of the infestation, and thereby not at all robots, but that’s way too much lore for this article.
2. Somewhere on YouTube, there’s a video of Digital Extremes’ community team being interviewed while driving. In the beginning, you can see the grocery store Remark in the car’s back window. I still find that cool.
3. The synthwave DJ’s abilities all center around your ability to play custom music to the enemies, doing damage thereby. More beats means more damage. Playing Darude: Sandstorm on repeat is, in my opinion, the single strongest path through the midgame.
4. When I say “far future,” I mean really far future. Far future enough that after an empire was able to rise up, figure out planetary terraforming, and subsequently collapse for unrelated reasons, the empire’s remnants later fucked up the big thermostat and managed to freeze Venus. 
5. Souls-like in style, if not in difficulty.
