Beyond the Appalachian mountains, there’s a small fishing town called Percé. The roads to it are long and treacherous, and once you’re there, you're as trapped as the lobsters of old. The town leaves you only one thing to do.

Listen.

## THE CALL OF THE GASPÉ

In an early morning of August 2016, the long pointed wings of yellow-headed gannets beat overhead as my father and I follow a silent call to Percé's five-hundred-metre limestone monolith: the famed Rocher Percé. Follow our tracks, and you’ll find the path to the great colossus barred, with all sorts of silly warnings given, like “danger: deadly rockfalls” and "do not, under any circumstances, approach."

My father can’t read French. We approached, on a quest to the monolith's hollow eye. We weren’t the only ones; back then, at low tide, crowds of curious tourists would span the sandbar, approaching the Rock’s towering edge. Most would reach it, astutely realize that the sandbar stretched no further, and satisfied, turn around. But the call was too loud; my father and I could not. Looking carefully, they should have seen the small pebble beach extending along between the Rock and the waves. At its end, the waters left no more but a debris field of chunks of stone protruding from the waves. The handful of remaining tourists would see it, be satisfied, they'd turn around.

My father and I could not. He leapt onto the first protruding stone. Then the next. I followed. Together, we would make chains of hasty, rhythmless leaps, only to pause, recenter and leap again, an Arrakis sandwalk on Atlantic stones. One or two remaining tourists would journey atop the stones, but inevitably, become satisfied, and turn around.

We could never turn around. Two children on the rocks, we followed a whispered call, the alluring song that ever since I first stepped out onto those Atlantic rocks, has left its hooks in my soul:

See.

## THE DEMAND TO BECOME 

And so, eight years later, we ran. Leaping from boulder to boulder, careful not to slip among the ancient erosion eating barnacle-filled crevasses into the smooth, red-orange curves underfoot, my father and I would see. Years of coastal erosion had eaten away at Percé’s southern cliff, leaving a debris field of red sandstone and shale. Beachgoers sunbathe on the distant smooth slopes, but our beach was this one, the coastal invitation, the challenge: prove yourself free.

Like children fearing imagined lava, we throw ourselves between the stones. With each step, my legs demand rock sink into the ground, its equal and opposite rebellion propelling me along the coppery shale path, at each landing, a battle of forces threatening to pull me in. My hands claw against the rockfaces, their rugged surfaces bite into my palms: pale flesh against one thousand maws, infinitesimal corners of stone. My upper body slams into wedged vertical boulders, the Earth carves crimson from my calves: liquid tribute drawn into the shale.

We trace two paths, my father and I. Our minds race: where to stop, where to leap, where to claw, twist, rotate, eject, slam, scale, repeat, amid it, thoughts retreat. We become living motion, force manifest. Days before the end we wouldn't voice, we followed the land’s challenge, the lesson written in shale:

Feel.

## A QUESTION BETWEEN INFINITIES

So in the night, I felt. As midnight cold settled upon the town the night before we finished our Eastern quest, I sat upon the Percé beach, peering into the beyond.

Percé’s beach is pebbled, and in the day, you see only the surface. At night, each pebble is inescapable; endless ancestors constructing the shoreline, only today’s generation open to the sun. In the day, the coastal stars were unseeable, hidden by waking life. But at night, each one sparkled at those sat upon the Earth’s edges, ever watching above. There, atop ancestor stones, below unreachable stars, a maroon hoodie from South Campus Hall.

Between the infinities, as the tourist town finally slept, the heaven beyond the Appalachians came to life. No more trying to outrun it, no more loud music, logistics, cars, no more metal at all. No more restaurants, roads, motion, no more flight. Only waves, pebbles, stars, and the wind. 

In the end, tried as we did, there was nowhere left to run.

So I posed the question to the infinity. The question that, unanswered, had driven my family to return again to this sacred place, this far side of the Appalachian wall.

Wrapped in midnight, answers came in a soft hush under the waves. 

## A LESSON ON THE MOUNTAIN

I followed its advice. With my last free hours in Percé, I climbed the mountain to visit an old friend. Eight years ago, I remembered her to be magnificent. Cristo Redentor of Brazil, hidden in the Gaspésie.

Yet her home is no Elysium. I found her in a clearing of unkempt wildflowers and wheatgrasses, with patches of red gravel interspersed. She has no royal marble pedestal; all her pews rest upon grey and ancient wood with wildflowers growing between the planks. The pews aren’t well cared-for; each sun-baked seat is misaligned and nailed down imprecisely. She’s up high, yes, but it’s mostly from the concrete stairway she stands on, with flaking black-painted railings and chips in the stone to reveal its gravelly flesh. 

She’s not magnificent either. Atop the pedestal, she’s so small. Only double my height, I think, and time has taken bites out of her painted white to reveal a porous interior, a milky core, pebble-pocked. Her halo isn’t resplendent, it’s barely held together: a circle of old halogen bulbs, the vast majority shattered long ago. Nor are her arms outstretched in glory.

They’re sheltering a marble-carved child, held tight to her chest.

Atop the mountain, sitting at her feet, close your eyes and listen. As the wind brushes through the pines, you’ll hear it whisper a small, priceless thing.

“I have you.”
