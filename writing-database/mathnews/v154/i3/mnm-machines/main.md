In mathNEWS 154.2, Lars Nootbar wrote of Tucker Carlson's obsessive hatred of modern day M&M's. The article was excellent, but surely, Tucker Carlson’s rants about M&M’s being a symbol of the downfall of freedom are entirely unfounded, right?

No. The M&M's machines are watching you.

On Saturday February 10th at 8:16 PM, r/uwaterloo user u/SquidKid47 posted a picture of a strange error message found upon one of the ubiquitous canary yellow M&M's machines[1]:

```

## WHO ARE THE COMPANIES INVOLVED AND WHAT DO THEY WANT WITH YOUR FACE?

Let’s take a few steps back. What exactly are these vending machines doing, and who is responsible? mathNEWS investigative journalist firstie contacted Plant Ops, who claim zero involvement with the vending machines. This leaves operational responsibility with the company operating the machines: Adaria Vending Services.

Adaria does not make the machines; firstie determined the machines’ original manufacturer to be Invenda Group, an organization boasting intelligent vending machines with data collection capabilities[2]. Some data collected is benign, including sales and UI performance metrics. But Adaria can also use these machines to collect further data, sending it to relevant parties including Mars, the manufacturer of M&M's. In particular, Invenda's sales brochures state the machines are capable of sending estimated ages and genders of every client.

This sounds familiar.

## CADILLAC FAIRVIEW’S DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION AFFAIR

Six years ago, Cadillac Fairview (CF)[3], owner of landmark shopping malls across Canada, became mired in controversy when the CBC discovered them to be using facial recognition software on unsuspecting patrons. Across eight weeks, they collected data on 5,061,324 patrons using secret cameras hidden within their malls’ informational kiosks.[4]

Sound familiar?

In the privacy commissioner of Canada’s subsequent investigation, it was revealed that Cadillac Fairview used the kiosks’ facial recognition capabilities for similar goals as Invenda machines enable: demographic data collection on users’ ages and genders.[4]

Facial recognition software isn’t inherently malicious. Many use Apple’s Face ID every day. The key is that in such situations, the individual provides express, meaningful consent. When personally-identifiable biometric data is used without express, meaningful consent, it often constitutes a privacy violation.

## A RESPONSE FROM ADARIA VENDING SERVICES

We could not responsibly publish this article without providing Adaria Vending Services the chance to respond. Below is their Director of Technology Services’ unedited response.

> What’s most important to understand is that the machines do not take or store any photos or images, and an individual person cannot be identified using the technology in the machines. The technology acts as a motion sensor that detects faces, so the machine knows when to activate the purchasing interface—never taking or storing images of customers. In partnership with Mars and Invenda, these machines are fully GDPR compliant and are in use in many facilities across North America.

> At the University of Waterloo, Adaria manages last mile fulfillment services—we handle restocking and logistics for the snack vending machines. Adaria does not collect any data about its users and does not have any access to identify users of these M&M vending machines. 

Although Adaria may not personally collect data from the machines, that does not prevent Invenda from collecting demographic information. Neither does it prevent Invenda from sending this information to M&M's manufacturer Mars.

## A CONTRADICTORY RESPONSE FROM INVENDA

Two hours before the mathNEWS publication deadline, we received the following response from Invenda's Founder and Executive Chairman:

> As the producer of the Invenda loT solution, the Invenda smart vending machine, and its associated software, we formally warrant that the demographic detection software integrated into the smart vending machine operates entirely locally. It does not engage in storage, communication, or transmission of any imagery or personally identifiable information. The software conducts local processing of digital image maps derived from the USB optical sensor in real-time, without storing such data on permanent memory mediums or transmitting it over the Internet to the Cloud.

They go on to say,

> It is imperative to note that the Invenda Software does not possess the capability to recognize any individual's identity or any other form of personal information.

> Further, Invenda's smart vending machines and its software are compliant with General Data Protection Regulation and equivalent data privacy policies.

On an attached FAQ sheet, they also state that "only the final data, namely presence of person, estimated age and estimated gender, is collected without any association with an individual." The document continues,

> **FAQ:** Do Invenda clients exclusively obtain anonymized analytical outcomes, such as usage frequency within specific
demographic trends, sales statistics, etc.?

> **Answer:** Clients are furnished with anonymized data analyses.

While Adaria claims the machines take no images of customers, and has no demographic imaging capabilties, Invenda contradicts them in saying they do—however, relevant data is only used locally.

In the Cadillac Fairview investigation, CF initially claimed their system did not store facial recognition data. Only through the investigation was it discovered that CF's vendor kept a database containing facial embeddings of over five million nonconsenting Canadians.

Caution is warranted.

## THE ARGUMENT FOR EXPRESS, MEANINGFUL CONSENT

Cadillac Fairview could have avoided controversy had their kiosks informed users facial recognition was in use. They did not.

In the privacy commissioner’s report, the commissioner emphasized that “shoppers had no reason to expect their image was being collected by an inconspicuous camera, or that it would be used, with facial recognition technology, for analysis.”[6] No one expected the M&M's machines to have cameras. The commissioner further decried “the lack of meaningful consent.”[6] No student consented to the cameras. Most relevant was the following:

> “If Cadillac Fairview were to use such technology in the future, it should take steps to obtain express, meaningful consent, before capturing and analyzing the biometric facial images of shoppers.”[6]

Express, meaningful consent means two things. One, that the individual understands the full context of what they consent to. Two, that the consent is express—it is not implied, but rather openly given by the individual. 

Adaria’s Invenda M&M's machines fail both counts.

On campus today, Adaria’s machines can conduct the privacy violations Cadillac Fairview ran afoul of. With almost imperceptible cameras, they identify biometric information of M&M's shoppers without our permission. Never in the user interaction flow are we asked “do you consent to having your biometric data scanned?”, because ideally, we shouldn't have known we are being scanned at all.

When Cadillac Fairview was caught using such practices, it was national news and warranted a privacy commissioner investigation. What will happen to Adaria, Invenda, and Mars?

## WHAT CAN YOU DO?

When the investigation concluded, Cadillac Fairview agreed to delete all information it had gained from the program. That was the limit of their punishment. Although the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) provides the ability to enforce fines on lawbreakers, no such measures were taken.[4] Canada shook its stick, and warned CF that should they try again, we will shake our stick even more firmly.

We are not so powerless. The University of Waterloo is an institution within which you have power. University administration often sounds deaf to our wants, but often, it is because there are needs they must counterbalance to our demands. 

No one needs M&M's cameras. 

Students can ask that University staff bar facial recognition vending machines from campus. Adaria’s Invenda machines can secretly read students' biometric data without our consent. With no consent, the M&M's machines' facial recognition follows in the footsteps of historical open violations of Canadian privacy law.
