across the road from northfield station, there’s a trail outstretched 

to a market well outside the St Jacobs boundaries

(they’ve named it St Jacobs anyway)

the government spent three million to pave it, celebrating its release with a sign declaring 

“do you love us yet?”

no one takes the trail.

❦

the first of its three segments walks you behind the unseen sides of the 401’s supplicants

unseen but not hidden; there’s nothing to hide in the undecorated concrete,

the exposed dirt. the ribbed metal, so flat, making up the warehouses’ outer skin.

grass is overgrown on each side of the track, not because it is free to grow, 

it is just too irrelevant to cut.

segment rating: 5.3 / 10.0.

❦

in the second segment, a woodlot encroaches upon the surrounding warehouses’ unmanicured lawns 

and distribution centers whose names you could almost make out

were branches not disrupting your customer journey

and muffling the roar of the monarch interminable, highway 85.

there’s no mutexes to synchronize the birdsong, but 

depth-first search may work on the trees

segment rating: 8 / 10. 

❦

in the third segment, leafy arms outstretch revealing an open pond on the far side of the salt line

the municipal trucks will not cross

no one walks this far along the path,  save for the sparrows who hop out of your way, surprised to see you

how did you get here?

beyond the pond, where one last woodlot remains

they put up a barbed wire fence once to keep you on the trail, and if you really look, you can see 

its rusted memory

segment rating: good. 

❦

if you decide to come back the same way, there’s a dirt hill minutes from northfield station, on the west side of the asphalt path

it’s surrounded by posts so high and grandiose

the satellite’s eyes take note[1] of the lights atop each post, three apiece,

all twenty-four face in, to light the pile of forgotten dirt, “This is our dirt. Do not disturb.”

“Those who deface it will be noted.”

the dirt has since grown into a hill of wild reeds

the lights must have felt

so terribly disrespected
