My friend,

I hope things are well at home.  All is well here, far outside the walls.  Within the heart of a heart, I’ve found a hidden balcony from which I write you now.  On Monday, I’ll gather with new friends and contribute this letter to mathNEWS—devoid of math and news, of course.  I hope you don’t mind if other people read it; I hope you’ll find someone to read it to you.

That Monday, we’ll gather to be together, catch up with old friends, and maybe make new ones.  We’ll translate heartbeats into words, gather for pizza under the evening sky, then thrive brightly hours into the night, before eventually drifting apart, back home, back to bed, forty thousand students filling maybe five streets.

Do they remember when it was not this way?  

From the Kitchener GO, a single set of tracks leads one hundred kilometers to a city, not three but one, that some of them call home. Outside the reach of its starlight is nothing, a shroud of darkness by night and void by day, which hides deep within a silent cluster of homes, a community in size, a cemetery in character.  They do not have mathNEWS meetings on Mondays.

We grew up in one such town, you and I.  It is surrounded on all sides, enclosed entirely by imposing walls of trees and sky, or fields and streams narrow enough to see the other side, but wide enough we could only yearn to cross.  From the center, we could run for only twenty minutes before finding ourselves bouncing off of the boundary, off of the river or field or highway, the ever-present bounds we used to call home.  You still do; it is not so small for you.  

The night only tightened its chains; the enclosure, once stretching to the great rivers and fields, contracted inwards to the four walls of our home—its edges now enforced not by space but by the coyote’s midnight lullaby.

One such night, you and I were left alone, told to lock the doors and seal ourselves away, because no one would do it for us.  One such night, you and I did not.

So we walked through the lightless night, twenty minutes in a single direction—it could have been ten, but you walk slowly; there is so much to smell.  Alone, we reached the main artery that led to the boundary; alone, we strode its lamplit runway; alone, we reached its border, unseen, unimpeded—there were no ION crossings to block our way.

At the border we found Nothing. Hiding under the intersection’s red and verdant neon glow, we could not see the trees across that intersection, nor the highways we took to school, nor the bridge we crossed to our families’ homes.  That night, we found nothing there but Nothing, a filled world hidden by that black wall, a blank canvas we could fill with naught but our silent hearts.

What would it be to live in a heart?  To pass through this Nothing, discovering within the beating core of an unsleeping greater creation?  To live within it, to experience amid ten thousand other souls, connected by naught but existing together, here, the same endless lightning of life joining our veins.  What would it be to share in their life, to live without bounds; to walk their roads or ride together along them, to eat their food from one thousand places we’ve never seen; to experience every moment amid an orchestra of others—others’ lives, others’ passions, others’ hearts.  What would it be for every night to be a new adventure, for every stone to be unturned, for every street to hold another story, for every group to play a different tune, for every beat to come together to shout to the world our rebellious song: we’re alive, we’re alive, we’re alive.

_Would someone please show me what it would be to be ALIVE?_

There is a tug at the rope on my hand.  I yearn into the dark edges of our tomb, but their silence has grown boring, and you are returning home.   

The next month I did not return with you.  I am finally alive, and the world is so bright.

I wish you were here to see it with me.
