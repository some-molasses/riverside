The animals were leaving.  
None of the local housecats remember the time before. In the before, the valley was full of wild creatures. Raccoons, turtles, the heron, and most importantly, the rabbit. None remain. None of the others are the subject of stories, legends even, told at the housecats’ secret midnight meets.  
The rabbit is different.  
When the humans came to the valley, they say the raccoons were the first to try to leave. The rabbit, however, had other plans. The raccoons saw job opportunities far away, it’s said; in the Toronto plain, garbage collectors were in high demand. Garbage collectors? They had garbage at home, the rabbit knew.  
When the humans came to transform the valley, cutting down trees and uprooting the forest floor, the rabbit stowed away their scraps. As they brought in their machines, the rabbit constructed a map of all their favourite dumping sites. When the humans installed trash cans, the rabbit journeyed into the pre-dawn fog, throwing his little weight against the black cans until they spilled their rotten contents onto the mud-coated ground. When the valley had been cleared, and only upturned dirt remained, the rabbit again found the raccoons.  
“Look\!”, said the rabbit, presenting his maps. “There is such garbage here\! I have drawn you maps, I have spread more for you to find\! You need not go away, everything you need is here\!” But the raccoons were already leaving. They expressed their appreciation, they invited him to visit, but no effort he made could get them to stay.  
It was not the same.  
He did not think about it long. Later that very day, he encountered the turtles with all their belongings stacked upon their shells. “Leaving now?” the rabbit exclaimed. “What about our Winter fair? What about our summer concerts? You can’t leave, you’ll never see them again\!”  
But the turtles dreamed of the sea. There was no sea in the valley.  
Not yet. The rabbit bounded to the human cabins. Days he stalked them; while the humans constructed the housecats’ homes, he learned their humans’ patterns, their vision, their habits, until one day, he snuck into their office. He took a pen between his teeth. On all the humans’ blueprints of the valley, he drew a great blue pond.  
Wooden frames rose. New trees sprouted from the earth. Paint and steel roared along their gravel roads, choking the air behind them. Soon enough, the humans dug a hole. Within the week, a great pond three hundred rabbit lengths across took shape within the valley.  
It was not enough. Their shells piled high, the turtles walked into the fields beyond. The valley had water, but for all the rabbit’s efforts to persuade the turtles otherwise, it was no sea.  
It was not the same.  
How could it happen? The raccoons had garbage, the turtles had water, but no one would stay. Human children ruled the valley now, and their lights cast away the darkness each night. Soon, only the rabbit and a lone heron remained. One day, the heron told the rabbit he was leaving too.  
In all the construction, the heron’s pond had been misplaced. But the rabbit could find it. As the humans took their great yellow machines away, and the last homes replaced dirt and mud for grass and trees, again the rabbit stole into the construction office again. With his tiny paws, he opened their steel drawers, searching through map after map. He found one.  
That night, the rabbit and the heron went on a journey. The last two creatures walked the paved streets, crossing between streetlight beams and mowed lawns. Arriving at a house, the rabbit dug his paws into the earth, carving a tunnel under their backyard fence. Within the home’s backyard, untouched, just as it always was, they found the heron’s pond.  
The heron stood in the waters. He stuck his nose into the water. He splashed with his wings. He looked at the rabbit, and turned his head.  
“Is this the same pond?”  
The rabbit was confused. Of course it’s the same pond, he had checked. Didn’t the heron recognize it? The rabbit double checked, he stood beside the heron and looked into the evening water; in its reflection, a rabbit and a heron looked back out at him.  
“It has to be the same,” the rabbit said. He looked at the heron, confused.  
“Perhaps it is the same pond, dear rabbit.”  
For a moment, he stood there.  
“But we are not in the same time.”  
The heron flew away.

The rabbit stayed in the old valley for a while longer. He went on his same morning forages. He still passed by the raccoons’ old warrens, now barren. He passed by the turtles’ old bushes, now a fire hydrant. He passed by the heron’s old pond, now locked away. New creatures came, but they were different. Younger. Brighter. He never got to know them. Winter came, and with it, frost. While the new creatures of the valley could convince the humans to let them into their warm homes, the rabbit never seemed able to.  
Ask any of the housecats of the valley, and they’ll tell you about him. The last rabbit. They won’t bring you to him though. The old ones say he was probably run over by a truck.  
But ask the youngest housecat, who lives in the house on the hill, and he’ll tell you a different story. He’ll tell you that one night, in a pure whiteout, the rabbit must have gotten lost, for the housecat saw him bounding by in the early morning light. By pure accident, he had made it atop the valley’s eastern hillside. He had made it out.  
From atop that hill, he could see not only his own valley, but countless more. Rich with life, some human, some wild. From above, they all looked the same. Even his own. Did he have to stay? There was no path to the valley of his youth.  
Only to the valley of that day.  
The housecats never saw him again.
